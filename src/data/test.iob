nothing O

the O

so O
did O
not O
eat O

much O
as O

certainly O
i O
think O
this O

deserves O
a O

the O

nothing O
that O

Well O

again O

But O
it O
pretty O
much O
masked O
the O
slightly O
raw O

of O
the O

One O
thing O
about O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
that O
is O
commendable O
is O
that O
their O
ingredients O
were O
really O
fresh O
and O
tasty O
, O
and O
the O
dim O
sums O
they O
serve O
were O
made O
upon O
each O

instead O
of O
being O
pre-steamed O

even O
though O
that O
would O
have O
helped O
them O
managed O
the O

better O

Here O
is O
the O
thoughts O
I O
felt O
when O
I O
patronage O
recently O
- O
custard B

was O
terrible O
, O
it O
was O
oily O
and O
poorly O
made O
- O
carrot B
cake I
was O
okay O
but O
I O
felt O
it O
was O
little O
for O
something O
nearing O
$ O
5 O
- O
service O
was O
terrible O
- O
ambient O
is O
really O
awful O
, O
they O
decided O
to O
cramp O
everyone O
. O

Service O
was O
basic O
, O
when O
its O
your O
turn O
, O
the O
servers O
will O
tell O
you O
which O
unit O
to O
go O
, O
and O
present O
you O
with O
a O
ordering O
form O
, O
complete O
your O
form O
and O
return O
it O
backto O
the O
server O
or O
bring O
it O
to O
the O
kitchen O
yourself O
. O

We O
waited O
for O
her O
finish O
her O
conversation O
for O
about O
two O
minutes O
, O
standing O
at O
the O
front O
of O
her O
desk O
. O

Maybe O
just O
feed O
the O
food O
to O
the O
zombies O
instead O
. O

Each O
time O
I O
visit O
, O
the O
items O
that O
get O
crossed O
out O
increases O

Failing O
to O
get O
anybody's O
attention O
, O
we O
turned O
away O
in O
complete O
disgust O
. O

There O
was O
a O
table O
that O
allowed O
their O
kid O
to O
bring O
along O
a O

to O
his O

and O
he O
gleefully O

We O

we O

we O

Enjoyed O
typically O
as O
a O
morning-after-exercise O
meal O
for O
the O
elderly O
, O
our O
families O
however O
only O
dined O
on O
it O
on O
our O
weekend O
family O
day O
. O

They O
pay O
attention O
to O
details O
and O
they O
are O
always O
smiling O
which O
give O
you O
the O
pleasant O
feel O
that O
they O
are O
always O
delighted O
to O
serve O
you O
. O

It O
was O
more O
like O
yam-water O

something O

Food O
was O
scrumptous O
and O
fresh O
ingredients O
were O
used O
in O
all O
the O

We O
ordered O
several O
dishes O
and O
the O
only O
that O
were O
acceptable O
were O
the O
malay B

Nevertheless O
, O
this O
dish O
wow O
us O
so O
much O
that O
we O
had O
to O
order O
an O

Finally O
got O
our O

not O

the O

We O
arrived O
just O

the O
moment O
the O

we O
walked O
straight O
into O

and O
despite O
hours O
on O
the O

, O
it O
still O
tasted O
so O
awesome O
after O
we O
toasted O
it O
. O

After O
months O
of O
waiting O
, O
in O
the O
hopes O
that O
the O
crowds O
would O
die O
down O
gradually O
, O
I O
finally O
got O
to O
eat O
this O
Hong O

at O

. O

Well O
, O
it's O
really O
something O
light O
& O
non-oily O
for O
breakfast O
, O
a O
healthy O
option O
. O

I O
am O
tempted O
to O
compare O
it O
to O
xiao O
long O
bao O
, O
just O
because O
they O
all O
fall O
under O
the O
category O
of O
stuff O
wrapped O
in O
skin O
. O

Over O
the O
last O
few O
years O
, O
it O
has O
consolidated O
into O
2 O
adjacent O
shoplots O
with O
slightly O
more O

We O
were O
actually O
planning O
to O
have O
dim O

at O
Swee O
Choon O
along O

when O
we O
realized O
that O
they O
closed O
at O

The O
dim O

are O
not O
fine O
at O
all O

nothing O

Since O
we O
were O
going O
to O
Sunshine O
Plaza O
for O
some O
photocopying O
/ O
laminating O
work O
, O
we O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
opportunity O
to O
stop O
by O
for O
some O
dim O
sum O
. O

reasonable O
standard O
. O

The O
whole O
purpose O
to O
be O
there O
is O
to O
take O
it O
slow O
and O
enjoy O
the O
dim O
sum O
with O
good O
company O
of O
your O
family O
and O
friends O
. O

Was O
this O
a O
dim O
sum O
, O
or O
was O
this O
a O
fish O
? O

Nothing O
to O
write O
home O
about O
really O
. O

Not O
bad O
, O
but O
not O
great O
. O

My O
favourites O
are O

It O
was O
juicy O
and O
fun O
to O
eat O
, O
with O
alot O
of O
contrasting O
tastes O
and O
texture O
. O

About O
20 O
minutes O
in O
, O
wondering O
if O
I O
could O
request O
specific O
item O
, O
I O
gestured O
at O
a O
waitress O
to O
come O
over O
. O
She O
gave O
me O
the O
hand O

Served O
in O
a O
dish O
rather O

i O
was O
a O
new O
fan O
until O
this O
morning O
, O
everything O
went O
downhill O
. O

They O
do O
offer O
sharks B
fin I
soups I
which O
our O
table O
did O
not O
sample O
( O
due O
to O
personal O
objections O
) O
however O
, O
we O
sampled O
a O
huge O
variety O
of O
other O
dishes O
ordering O
4 O
dishes O
at O
a O
time O
then O
ordering O
the O
next O
4 O

, O
this O
way O
we O
didn't O
have O
everything O
arriving O
at O
the O
same O
time O
and O
going O
cold O
. O

On O
this O
they O
really O
do O
a O
good O
job O
compared O
to O
most O
other O
restaurants O
with O
a O
similarly O
length O
of O
waiting O
diners O

it's O
not O
that O

was O
at O

about O
a O
month O
ago O
for O
my O
dad O

birthday O
dinner O
and O
despite O
knowing O
that O
we O
were O
unlikely O
to O
run O
in O
with O
a O
crowd O
on O
a O
Sunday O
evening O

I O
went O

a O
small O
little O

at O

which O
serves O
decent O

The O

fluffy O
and O
soft O
with O
a O
thin O
skin O
and O
a O
generous O
scoop O
of O
egg O

inside O
. O

They O
had O
a O
nice O
skin O
which O
was O
smooth O
and O
of O
the O
right O
thickness O
. O

Once O
you're O
seated O
, O
someone O
will O
attend O
to O
you O
almost O
immediately O
. O

oh O
, O
the O
amount O

a O

the O

made O

rather O
perculiar O
in O
my O

It's O

though O

( O

it O
is O
indeed O
crisp O
fried O
and O
it O
goes O
well O
with O
the O
soothing O
and O
palate-cleansing O
plum O

. O

The O
place O
was O
functionally O
furnished O
with O
no O
attention O
paid O
to O
decor O
or O
comfort O
. O

Had O
to O
try O
this O
restaurant O
after O
reading O
all O
the O
reviews O
everwhere O
. O

But O
there O
wasn't O
enough O
sauce O
this O
time O
. O

Firstly O
, O
expect O
a O
queue O

ordered O

If O
they O
do O
not O
welcome O
family O
with O
kids O
( O
that O
need O
two O
chairs O
to O
reach O
table O
) O
, O
do O
make O
it O
up O
front O
to O
the O
customer O
or O
put O
up O
signage O
. O

Compared O
to O
Din O
Tai O
Fung O
, O
Swee O
choon's O
has O
thicker O
skin O
which O
is O
less O
than O
perfect O
. O

it's O
light O
n O
crispy O
n O
flavourful O
.. O

It O
was O
both O
, O
with O
a O
twist O
. O

Mostly O
it O
is O
just O
me O
not O
liking O
the O
idea O
of O
cramping O
on O
small O
dinky O
tables O
and O
chairs O
at O
a O
kopitiam O

to O
eat O
dim O

To O
those O
of O
you O
who O
don't O
know O
where O
is O
this O
, O
this O
is O
near O

The O

I O
havent O
got O
a O
chance O
to O
try O

due O
to O
the O
packed O

at O

I O
tried O

for O
more O
than O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
our O
second O
round O
, O
which O
really O
doesn't O
make O
sense O
from O
a O
business O
perspective O
because O
we O
are O
buying O
more O
stuff O
, O
AND O
it O
was O
obviously O
a O
ploy O
to O
try O
get O
us O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant O
faster O
. O

Next O
, O
another O
item O
from O
the O
Big O
4 O
Heavenly O
Kinds O
list O
- O
the O
Pan-fried B
Carrot I
Cake I
- O
which O
was O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
fine O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

I O
was O
a O
particular O
fan O
of O
the O
carrot B
cake I
and O
egg B
tarts I
. O

The O
filling O
was O
creamy O
and O
oozed O
out O
when O
I O
bit O
into O
it O
. O

This O
adds O
on O
to O
the O
variety O
of O
dishes O
which O
we O
could O
try O
. O

This O
Chinese O
restaurant O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
in O
Singapore O
that O
the O
tables O
are O
far O
apart O
that O
you O
can O
hold O
a O
conversation O
without O
being O
overheard O
by O
the O
next O
table O
. O

Victor's O
Kitchen O
opens O
at O
1030am O
, O
and O
by O
the O
time O
we O
got O
there O
, O
it O
was O
packed O
to O
the O
brim O
with O
couples O
and O
families O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
dishes O
were O
quite O
disappointing O
, O
but O
nonetheless O
, O
the O
golden B
egg I
yolk I
lava I
buns I
totally O
made O
up O
for O
it O
. O

Food O
is O
generally O
too O
over O
priced O
and O
not O
fantastic O
. O

First O
thing O
first O
, O
the O
rice O
is O
hard O
, O
too O
hard O
. O

But O
it O
was O
a O
satisfying O
meal O
that O
didn O
t O
leave O
me O
in O
surfeit O
, O
which O
is O
good O
. O

Beancurd B

Roll I
( O

- O
The O
beancurd B
prawn I
roll I
is O
a O
pretty O
good O
item O
to O
order O
. O

Classically O
the O
must-haves O
when O
one O
dines O
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
we O
certainly O
could O
not O
do O
without O
! O

Doesn't O
look O
special O
at O
all O
but O
when O
you O
bite O
it O
, O
ooh O
la O
la O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
fragrance O
from O
the O
charred O
parts O
of O
the O
exterior O
layer O
was O
deliciously O
comforting O
. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O

The O
one O
here O
is O
seriously O
one O
BIG O
da B

50 O
cents O
I O
can O
afford O
but O
just O
disgusted O
by O
the O
attitude O
so O
deliberately O
insist O
on O
cancelling O
the O
water O
. O

Sad O
to O
say O
, O
the O
name O
speaks O
for O
the O
whole O
outlook O
; O
simple O
& O
non-appealing O
to O
the O
eye O
but O
the O
crowd O
gets O
one O
wondering O
if O
it's O
really O
that O
fantastic O
for O
a O
small O
shopfront O
like O
that O
? O

the O
rest O
is O
so O
forgettable O
. O

Oh O
yes O

Personally O
, O
I O
find O
it O
bland O
because O
I O
cannot O
have O
my O
porridge O
without O
sesame O
oil O
. O

How O
amazing O
is O
that O

Another O

I O
liked O
the O

of O
the O

of O

since O
it O
compounded O
the O

Quite O

I O
used O
to O
go O
this O

the O

This O

reaffirms O
my O
belief O
that O
the O
most O
expensive O
meals O
one O
can O
have O
in O
Singapore O
are O
in O

A O

the O

the O

Half O

you O

you O
have O
to O
have O
a O
bit O
of O

go O
with O
it O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
waitress O
for O
it O
and O
my O
request O
was O
casually O
asked O
to O
wait O

The O
texture O
was O

are O
just O
so O
so O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
they O
can O
rave O
about O
is O
the O
ingredients O
are O
really O
fresh O
, O
but O
nothing O
else O
. O

still O
bearable O
... O

wasnt O
too O
much O
a O
fan O
of O

it O

probably O
added O

Had O
the O

a O

meant O
that O
we O
could O
order O
many O

It O
was O
such O
a O
horrible O

that O
I'm O

creating O
an O

that O
you O
won't O
make O

was O
steamed O
to O

Decided O
to O
go O
for O
the O

to O
warm O
up O
- O
thought O
we O
could O
count O
on O
that O

either O

just O

The O

all O
right O

though O

Without O
a O
doubt O
, O
the O
one O
item O
that O
a O
diner O
never O
fails O
to O
order O
during O
dim O

would O
be O
that O
of O
Har B

or O
the O

I O
would O
love O
to O
have O
it O
there O
but O
mother O
in O
law O
cooked O
and O
cannot O
let O
her O
down O
. O

Not O
impress O
with O
... O

True O
, O
there O
may O
be O
other O
places O
with O
better O
food O
, O
but O
the O
atmosphere O
is O
different O

not O
worth O
your O
money O
and O
time O
. O

Vermicell B

The O

But O
the O

attached O

Drinks O
also O
quite O
good O
... O

The O
Glutinous B

was O
amazing O
. O

What O
a O
load O
of O
rubbish O
? O

I O
enjoyed O
the O

tremendously O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
dish O
was O
good O
apart O
from O
the O

that O
it O
was O
left O

I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
this O

probably O

to O
these O
factors O

we O

The O
most O
impressive O
item O
is O
definitely O
the O
baked O

Her O
comments O
were O
stinging O
- O
( O
Is O

just O
the O

of O

, O
portuguese B

and O

However O
the O
only O
drawback O
is O
that O
you O
would O
have O
to O
finish O
it O
as O
soon O
as O
possible O
or O
it O
would O
start O
to O
turn O
watery O
. O

Not O
only O
was O
the O
wonton O
skin O
silky O
smooth O
, O
the O
sauce O
was O
AMAZING O
! O

Onto O
the O
food O
, O
usual O
dim O
sum O
staple O
like O
the O
har B
kow I
failed O
to O
impress O
although O
the O
prawn O
inside O
was O
huge O
. O

My O
parents O
certainly O
felt O
cheated O
. O

It O
was O
smooth O
and O
creamy O
. O

No O
Chee B
Cheong I
Fun I
for O
me O
because O
it O
is O
the O
regular O
kind O
and O
not O
the O
steamed O
Cantonese O
sort O
. O

The O
silky O
texture O
is O
simply O
amazing O
. O

Cherry O
garden O
definitely O
serves O
plush O
, O
good O
and O
interesting O
dim O

. O

You O
can O
still O
find O
some O
pretty O
good O
duck O
dishes O
at O
high O
end O
restaurants O
, O
but O
the O
price O
is O
also O
very O
' O
high O
end O
' O
! O
:) O

( O
- O
) O
Once O
again O
, O
too O
oily O
for O
my O
personal O
preference O
. O

The O
oil O
was O
seeping O
through O
the O
bun O
skin O
and O
leaving O
it O
soggy O
! O

This O
day O
, O
I O
had O
no O
such O
luck O
. O

One O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
that O
I O
get O
really O
thirsty O
after O
having O
the O
dim O
sum O
. O

The O
waitress O
Bei O
( O
something O
like O
this O
name O
) O
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

With O
three O
adults O
and O
two O
kids O
, O
we O
spent O
about O
$ O
65 O
. O

Only O
two O
carts O
stopped O
at O
our O
table-of-two O
throughout O
the O
entire O
hour O
we O
were O
there O
. O

Go O
before O
10am O
to O
get O
a O
seat O
without O
waiting O
. O

The O
wasabi B
prawns I
were O
also O
tasty O
yet O
not O
too O
extrusive O
on O
the O
wasabi O
. O

By O
the O
time O
, O
it O
was O
officially O
opened O
to O
the O
public O
. O

So O
after O
our O
recent O
re-visit O
to O
the O
Dim O
Sum O
House O
, O
we O
have O
, O
as O
unanimously O
as O
we O
did O
before O
, O
condemned O
on O
how O
its O
quality O
of O
food O
has O
plunged O
tremendously O
. O

but O
at O
least O
a O
decent O
service O
... O

So O
Mao O
Mao O
go O
to O
famous O
dian O
xin O
shop O
. O

now O
, O
the O
food O
. O

As O
for O
the O
Braised B
Seafood I
Soup I
, O
one O
can O
definitely O
conclude O
that O
the O
chef O
is O
generous O
with O
the O

I O
still O
remember O
the O
days O
when O
I O
was O
still O
studying O
at O
NAFA O
, O
me O
and O
my O
classmate O
would O
always O
go O
for O
our O
lunch O
break O
there O
whenever O
we O
have O
craving O
for O
Dim O
Sum O
. O

It O
will O
not O
break O
your O
wallet O
but O
it O
will O
satisfy O
you O
very O
much O
. O

The O
carrot O
and O
radish O
flavors O
were O
very O
prominent O
here O
and O
one O
could O
actually O
find O
tiny O
bits O
of O
carrot O
and O
radish O
within O
the O
pan-fried O
pastry O
itself O
. O

The O
Fried B
Custard I
Pumpkins I
were O
rather O
unique O
, O
we O
rarely O
see O
it O
around O
in O
Singapore O
. O

It O
was O
tender O
and O
came O
with O
chilli O
slices O
in O
a O
not-too-thick O
sauce O
, O
which O
was O
savoury O
and O
sweet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

Their O
dim O
sum O
comes O
in O
trollies O
with O
the O
aunties O
pushing O
them O
and O
speaking O
in O
cantonese O

pancake I
: O
The O
skin O
is O
thicker O
than O
the O
usual O
popiah O
skin O
or O
crepe O
skin O
, O
really O
much O
like O
a O
thin O
pancake O
. O

It O
is O
advisable O
to O
be O
there O
before O
8am O
if O
you O
want O
to O
go O
there O
for O
a O
dim O
sum O
breakfast O
. O

Not O
as O
what O
newspapers O
commented O
. O

However O
, O
one O
bite O
and O
BOOM O
I'm O
an O
instant O
fan O
. O

It's O
chewy O
and O
has O
non-sticky O
texture O
, O
wrapping O
around O
a O
huge O
succulent O
prawn O
. O

Benchmarked O
against O
the O
usual O
HK O
themed O
cafe O
- O
I O
find O
Victor's O
food O
alot O
better O
and O
fresher O
but O
I O
am O
biased O
. O

When O
having O
dessert O
, O
Joy O
gave O
my O
MIL O
the O
birthday O
cake O
and O
2 O
roses O
. O

The O
Har B
Gow I
wasn't O
very O
nice O
though O
. O

Simply O
because O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
last O
restaurant O
that O
serves O
value O
for O
money O
dim O
sum O
. O

The O
lady O
at O
the O
cashier O
suddenly O
got O
angry O
and O
insisted O
that O
she O
told O
me O
that O
this O
dish O
need O
time O
, O
and O
didn O
t O
even O
apologies O
for O
not O
informing O
me O
at O
the O
start O
. O

Yay O
to O
cheap O
and O
awesome O
supper O
places O
. O

I O
do O
agree O
that O
the O
standard O
is O
not O
quite O
the O
same O
as O
the O
begining O
. O

It's O
definitely O
overhyped O
, O
but O
it's O
HEALTHY O
and O
AFFORDABLE O
. O

He's O
had O
a O
good O
recipe O
for O
the O
bun O
and O
the O
texture O
of O
the O
char O
siew O
is O
good O
. O

personally O

The O

i O
always O
enjoy O
the O

they O

We O

SOOOOOOO O
SOOOO O

So O
my O
advice O
is O
to O
go O
there O
at O
9am O
for O
minimal O
waiting O
time O
! O

) O
On O
the O
Service O
Quick O
and O
efficient O
. O

The O
salted O
egg O
custard O
gushes O
out O
the O
moment O
you O
break O
the O
bun O
. O

After O
searching O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
we O
taxi O
to O
this O
restaurant O
arriving O
before O
10:30 O
am O
Sunday O
with O
fortunately O
no O
queue O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
wider O
range O
of O
dim O
sim O
here O
than O
other O
places O
. O

The O
bun O
itself O
was O
soft O
, O
fluffy O
and O
light O
as O
a O
feather O
while O
the O
fillings O
were O
so O
, O
so O
sweet O
and O
juicy O
. O

i O
guess O
the O
next O
time O
we O
will O
just O
go O
to O
the O
usual O
other O
dim O
sum O
places O
that O
we O
know O
. O

I O
also O
order O
the O
Summer B
Milk I
tea I
. O

With O
newspaper O
clippings O
plastered O
all O
over O
their O
glass O
shopfront O
, O
it O
seemingly O
gave O
an O
assurance O
that O
their O
dim O
sum O
were O
good O
or O
way O
commercialized O
. O

Eat O
at O
Ji O
De O
Chi O
if O
you O
want O
such O
desserts O
. O

No O
wonder O
there's O
a O
limit O
order O
of O
a O
plate O
( O
of O
3 O
) O
to O
each O
person O
, O
The O
soft O
crispy O
skin O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
probably O
coated O
with O
sugary O
butter O
, O
gives O
the O
bun O
a O
sweet O
finishing O
touch O
. O

This O
was O
a O
much O
welcome O
change O
from O
the O
commonly O
spotted O
rice O
and O
noodle O
dishes O
. O

He O
was O
very O
rude O
and O
told O
us O
that O
We O
are O
selling O
more O
than O
hundreds O
of O
xiao B
long I
bao I
everyday O
, O
yet O
no O
one O
complaint O
to O
us O
! O

Most O
probably O
, O
for O
their O
la B
mian I
, O
custard B
bun I
& O
XLB B
;) O

You O
get O
tons O
of O
aunties O
and O
white-haired O
uncles O
sitting O
with O
their O
families O
, O
digging O
into O
dim O
sum O
. O

even O
if O
it O
is O
free O
, O
I O
will O
still O
consider O
wanna O
force O
myself O
into O
such O
meal O
or O
not O
? O

A O
simply O
fab O
combination O
! O

as O
mentioned O
, O
the O
quality O
and O
consistency O
of O
the O
food O
easily O
matches O
what O
you O
would O
get O
at O
a O
high O
end O
restaurant O
, O
while O
you O
can O
order O
enough O
to O
make O
you O
really O
full O
( O
i'm O
quite O
a O
big O
eater O
) O
for O
below O
$ O
20 O
each O
. O

TIP O
: O
people O
going O
back O
there O
because O
of O
nostalgia O
does O
not O
necessariyl O
translate O
into O
good O
food O
or O
service O
. O

Well O
, O
it O
seemed O
like O
many O
others O
were O
thinking O
on O
the O
same O
wavelength O
because O
we O
waited O
for O
about O
40 O
minutes O
before O
a O
table O
became O
available O
. O

not O
Rochor O
quality O
but O
no O
one O
worries O
about O
the O
difference O
these O
days O
. O

Pork O
dumplings O
. O

On O
the O
walls O
of O
the O
shop O
were O
posters O
promoting O
their O
signature O
Golden B
Egg I
Yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
and O
indeed O
on O
every O
table O
, O
there O
was O
at O
least O
1 O
serving O
testimonial O
of O
the O
popularity O
of O
the O
Golden B
Egg I
Yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
. O

I O
can't O
really O
taste O
the O
XO O
sauce O
but O
the O
carrot B
cake I
is O
smooth O
with O
a O
hint O
of O
seafood O
. O

Its O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
which O
serves O
dim O
sum O
on O
push O
carts O
. O

The O
bun O
was O
also O
just O
about O
the O
right O
size O
and O
it O
was O
served O
to O
us O
hot O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
some O
thought O
that O
it O
tasted O
weird O
. O

The O
place O
is O
packed O
with O
people O
and O
we O
ordered O
the O
following O
items O
: O
- O
Pan B
Fried I
Chee I
Cheong I
Fun I
: O
This O
was O
topped O
with O
Soya O
sauce O
before O
serving O
us O
. O

the O
filling O
was O
well O
, O
meh O
. O

the O
only O
one O
that O
was O
good O
was O
the O
Seafood B
Broth I
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
a O
crazy O
experience O
for O
us O
. O

would O
be O
the O
kind O
of O
hot O

one O
would O
look O
forward O
to O
on O
a O
cold O
and O
rainy O
day O
. O

The O
fried B
you-tiao I
here O
is O
crispy O
and O
yet O
soft O
, O
which O
is O
much O
better O
than O
those O
hard O
ones O
offered O
in O
some O
restaurants O
. O

Then O
, O
major O
disappointment O
came O
when O
i O
ate O
the O
JUICELESS O
XIAO B
LONG I
BAO I
. O
WHAT O
? O
! O
? O
! O
? O
! O
! O
! O

Quaint O
may O
be O
in-thing O
now O
, O
but O
Red O
Star O
Restaurant O
( O
old O
as O
it O
is O
) O
was O
nothing O
quaint O
and O
charming O
. O

For O
reading O
till O
the O
end O
, O
here's O
something O
surprising O
: O
Did O
you O
know O
that O
Swee O
Choon O
sells O
strawberry B
cheescake I
( O
$ O
9 O
) O
? O

Such O
an O
unexpected O
exquisite O
taste O
compared O
to O
the O
others O
I've O
tried O
! O

Har B
gow I
was O
decent O
although O
the O
shrimps O
were O
not O
terribly O
fresh O
. O

Though O
simply O
done O
, O
the O
sweetness O
from O
the O
chilled O
water O
melon O
blended O
well O
with O
the O
slightly O
salty O
and O
raw O
taste O
of O
the O
scallop O
and O
the O
garlic O
- O
chilli O
citrus O
jus O
added O
a O
tinge O
of O
spice O
and O
zest O
. O

Only O
found O
out O
after O
my O
2nd O
time O
trying O
. O

Phoneix B
Porridge I
consist O
of O
century O
eggs O
and O
chicken O
. O

It O
seems O
like O
his O
wife O
is O
taking O
charge O
now O
as O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
him O
at O
the O
outloet O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
and O
the O
food O
quality O
is O
going O
from O
bad O
to O
worse O
. O

Venison B
tasted O
too O
gamey O
and O
not O
as O
fresh O
as O
I O
would O
like O
it O
. O

Prawn O
and O
pork O
, O
were O
absent O
. O

Not O
starchy O
unlike O
most O
congee O
, O
the O
porridge O
was O
easy O
for O
the O
throat O
to O
slurp O
down O
. O

we O
left O
, O
well-fed O
and O
satisfied O
. O

there's O
also O
this O
custard O
pumpkin O
dessert O
type O
which O
is O
quite O
survoury O
outer O
n O
sweet O
inner O
.. O

One O
of O
the O
kueh O
could O
have O
been O
fried O
a O
little O
longer O
. O

Really O
fast O
! O

Their O
xiao B
long I
bao I
is O
quite O
good O
but O
still O
not O
comparable O
to O
crystal O
jade's O
. O

This O
is O
the O
highlight O
of O
the O
trip O
! O

Indeed O
you O
dont O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
strongly O
recommend O
Swee O
Choon O
Dim O
Sum O
due O
to O
its O
unique O
range O
of O
dishes O
served O
with O
very O
cheap O
prices O
. O

Loud O
crunches O
could O
be O
heard O
when O
we O
all O
bit O
into O
the O
spring O
rolls O
but O
disappointment O
hit O
us O
soon O
after O
as O
the O
tasteless O
egg O
white O
touched O
our O
palates O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
also O
ordered O
the O
char B
siew I
bao I
, O
xiao B
long I
bao I
and O
roast B
duck I
drumstick I
. O

It O
somehow O
resembled O
a O
Bolo O
bun O
with O
the O
baked O
exterior O
which O
was O
fragrant O
. O

Felt O
like O
they O
didn't O
soak O
the O
skin O
long O
enuff O
to O
remove O
the O
beancurdish O
taste O
. O

The O
food O
and O
dessert O
selection O
here O
were O
truly O
unique O
. O

The O
main O
dining O
hall O
overlooks O
the O
Marina O
Bay O
and O
can O
accommodate O
only O
70 O
people O
at O
a O
time O
, O
making O
this O
weekend-only O
lunch O
experience O
cosy O
and O
exclusive O
. O

Favorites O
and O
must-trys O
are O
the O
siew B
mai I
, O
egg B
tarts I
and O
shrimp B
dumplings I
. O

The O
har B
gow I
( O
shrimp B
dumpling I
) O
and O
siew B
mai I
were O
really O
tasty O
. O

Chilli O
was O
good O
- O
I'll O
give O
them O
that O
. O

They O
occupy O
a O
stall O
there O
just O
so O
that O
there's O
more O
space O
for O
patrons O
. O

3 O
of O
us O
shared O
the O
bill O
which O
is O
abt O
$ O
10 O
/ O
pax O
. O

Service O
is O
not O
very O
friendly O
, O
but O
I O
like O
to O
go O
there O
at O
least O
once O
a O
week O
. O

But O
overall O
a O
great O
dining O
experience O
. O

There O
was O
a O
fine O
line O
separating O
soft O
moist O
glutinous O
rice O
and O
mushy O
and O
this O
unfortunately O
came O
not-so-desirable O
by O
our O
palate's O
standards O
. O

Ambiance O
here O
is O
excellent O
to O
give O
you O
a O
comfy O
feel O
. O

Don't O
expect O
wet O
towelettes O
and O
pristine O
tablewear O
here O
. O

For O
my O
parent's O
anniversary O
this O
year O
, O
we O
wanted O
to O
go O
somewhere O
nice O
and O
seeing O
how O
none O
of O
us O
can O
really O
take O
buffets O
for O
dinner O
anymore O
and O
my O
dad's O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
China O
Man O
... O

The O
other O
customers O
bought O
a O
set O
per O
pax O
, O
need O
I O
explain O
why O
? O

They O
also O
have O
a O
takeaway O
shop O
next O
to O
the O
restaurant O
which O
is O
very O
popular O
. O

though O
the O
translucent O
skin O
was O
thin O
, O
it O
was O
competent O
in O
enveloping O
the O
succulent O
prawn O
without O
breaking O
apart O
. O

These O
include O
: O
1 O
. O

will O
be O
better O
with O
more O
aloe O
vera O
than O
jelly O
. O

After O
having O
the O
Golden B
Egg I
Yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
, O
this O
was O
really O
just O
average O
. O

I O

Victor's O

( O

one O

this O
was O
too O
oily O
for O
my O
liking O

The O
tim O
sum O
is O
good O
value O
for O
money O
. O

Overall O
the O
dim O

dishes O
aren't O
fanciful O
to O
me O
. O

We O
each O
had O
a O
bowl O
of O
la B

as O
well O
. O

At O
least O
at O
a O
fast O
food O
restaurant O
they O
let O
you O
eat O
in O
peace O
. O

Translucent-thin O
skin O
of O
the O
Steamed B
Prawn I

tasted O
springy O
and O
not O
too O
chewy O
while O
its O
filling O

fresh O

was O
marinated O
just O
nice O

Carrot B

( O

found O
it O
pretty O
bland O
and O
, O
like O
a O
typical O
Singaporeans O
, O
ended O
up O
dousing O
it O
in O
chilli O

My O

like O
to O
have O
tim O
sum O
at O
this O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food O
is O
nice O

cheap O
. O

And O
because O
they O
serve O
so O
fast O
, O
our O
food O
turned O
cold O
and O
dry O

It's O
totally O
not O
worth O

oozing O
out O
of O
the O

, O
tempting O
you O
with O
both O
visual O
and O
taste O
. O

Figured O
it O
was O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
sit O
and O
if O
it O
sucks O
, O
I O
could O
escape O
those O

The O
only O
thing O
is O
that O
when O
we O

( O
with O

, O
there O
is O
no O

you O

how O

each O
item O
cost O
( O
unless O
you O
ask O
the O

taker O
for O
it O
one-by-one O
) O
and O
when O
calculating O
the O
price O
, O
the O
staff O
simply O
did O
the O
sum O
in O
her O
mind O

gave O
you O
a O
magic O

The O
Deer B
Meat I
with I
Ginger I

Onion I
was O
decent O
also O
- O
deer O
tastes O
a O
little O
like O
a O
cross O
between O
chicken O
and O
pork O
- O
its O
not O
really O
chicken O
because O
its O
not O
so O
tough O
or O
lean O
, O
pork O
because O
well O
it O
feels O
a O
little O
fatty O
. O

Any O
later O
than O
that O
, O
you O
probably O
have O
to O
queue O
for O
at O

1 O
hour O
, O
minimum O
. O

the O
you O
tiao O
was O
still O
slightly O

served O
it O

us O

The O
seemingly O
bland O
dish O
( O
the O
mee O
sua O
inside O
was O
really O
white O

tasted O
surprisingly O
good O
and O
fragrant O

so O
do O
not O
underestimate O
it O

Will O

The O
scallop O

also O
did O
not O
feature O

this O

We O
left O
the O

ananimously O

that O
that O

the O

really O
didnt O

I O
already O

the O

sinking O
my O
teeth O
into O
it O

it O
way O
beyond O
my O

plans O

do O
try O
to O
park O
at O

that O
one O
could O
just O
take O

Don't O
like O

The O
tofus O
were O
crispy O

The O

Prawns O

and O
the O
transluent O
skin O
clinging O

were O
thin O
and O
soft O
, O
yet O
firm O
enough O
to O
hold O
the O
entire O
dumpling O
together O
without O
falling O
apart O
. O

We O
suddenly O
felt O
over-charged O
all O
these O
while O
, O
as O
their O
cost O
of O
hiring O
these O
illegal O
workers O
should O
be O
lower O
and O
thus O
their O
high O
prices O
were O
not O
justified O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
the O

lousy O

the O

just O
took O
an O
empty O

after O
picking O
our O

on O
the O

we O
passed O
it O

hope O
this O
review O
will O
alert O
potential O
customers O
to O
the O
bad O
service O
evident O
here O
. O

If O
you O
have O
not O
tried O
Swee O
Choon O
, O
you've O
not O
tried O
Singapore O
dim O

. O

( O
Think O
those O
classic O
Japanese O
' O
rock O
melon O
pan O
' O
buns O
) O
Comparatively O
, O
the O
rendition O
tried O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
was O
crisp O
but O
crumbly O
upon O
each O
bite O
. O

We O
ordered O
some O
steamed O
dim O
sum O
and O
their O
signature O
xiao B

bao I
. O

i've O
long O
heard O
about O
this O
restaurant O
as O
it's O
been O
around O
for O
many O
years O
and O
always O
wanted O
to O
try O
their O
dim O
sum O
. O

not O
to O
be O
outdone O
, O
the O
auntie O
starts O
asking O
us O
if O
we O
want O
tea O
. O

Dining O
there O
is O
inexpensive O
though O
. O

Halfway O
throuh O
the O
meal O
, O
with O
food O
clearly O
still O
on O
the O
table O
, O
they O
were O
already O
asking O
if O
they O
could O
clear O
the O
dishes O
. O

I O
added O
two O
extra O
orders O
to O
my O
meal O
after O
finishing O
the O
previous O
orders O
and O
the O
add O
on O
food O
arrived O
in O
less O
than O
5 O
minutes O
. O

Perhaps O
I O
was O
hankering O
for O
something O
sweeter O
and O
more O
complex O
; O
I O
found O
this O
to O
be O
a O
tad O
flat O
with O
no O
dimensions O
of O
taste O
and O
textures O
, O
and O
my O
sweet O
tooth O
certainly O
didn O
t O
approve O
of O
this O
either O

Verdict O

When O
the O
buns O
were O
served O
, O
I O
immediately O
peeled O
one O
open O
and O
was O
so O
thrilled O
at O
the O
sight O
of O
the O
rich O
, O
golden O
filling O
oozing O
out O
of O
the O
pearly O
white O
bun O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
Chef O
Mak O
mentioned O
in O
one O
of O
his O
interviews O
, O
he O
has O
tested O
the O
local O
pig's O
liver O
until O
he O
was O
satisfied O
with O
the O
texture O
although O
there O
is O
still O
a O
slight O
different O
compare O
to O
the O
Hong O
Kong's O
pig's O
liver O
which O
is O
even O
more O
tender O
. O

The O
friend O
stuff O
were O
cold-ish O
and O
hard O
. O

Extremely O
heavenly O
just O
lapping O
up O
the O
flowing O
goodness O
. O

It O
gave O
us O
a O
very O
authentic O
and O
traditional O
vibe O
. O

d O
) O
Queen O
size O
Siew B
Mai I
Don't O
be O
fooled O
by O
the O
word O
' O
QUEEN O
' O
, O
it O
is O
not O
as O
huge O
as O
the O
name O
given O
. O

Serive O
is O
very O
lousy O
especially O
during O
the O
busy O
hours O
. O

The O
place O
is O
charming O
because O
it's O
old O
. O

As O
you O
can O
see O
, O
Swee O
Choon O
offers O
a O
wide O
variety O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
and O
Shanghai O
dim O
sum O
, O
and O
local O
zi O
char O
dishes O
. O

First O
, O
we O
thought O
it O
opened O
at O
10:30 O
am O
, O
everyone O
was O
queuing O
up O
and O
waiting O
outside O
the O
shop O
. O

Next O
, O
was O
mushroom O
, O
conpoy O
, O
roasted O
duck O
, O
lotus O
chicken O
, O
black O
moss O
and O
wolfberries O
. O

Hence O
, O
we O
added O
50cents O
for O
the O
above O
. O

Another O
piece O
of O
art O
we O
seen O
, O
at O
the O
gallery O
of O
Cherry O
Garden O
. O

first O
she O
said O
you O
pay O
S O
$ O
15 O
but O
when O
i O
asked O
her O
to O
ask O
the O
manager O
she O
came O
back O
after O
some O
time O
& O
said O
it O
was O
free O
. O

At O
the O
price O
they O
charge O
you O
find O
better O
food O
at O
Better O
restaurant O
or O
hotel O
. O

i O
especially O
liked O
the O
la B

, O
char B
siew I

and O
xiao B
long I

. O

Went O
there O
for O
a O
la O
carte O
dinner O
, O
spent O
about O
$ O
980 O
for O
the O
9 O
of O
us O
. O

the O
dimsum O
is O
not O
the O
best O
i've O
tasted O
, O
but O
its O
good O
value O
for O
money O
. O

This O
was O
what O
I O
and O
my O
family's O
feedback O
: O
1 O
. O

We O
were O
there O
on O
a O
Friday O
night O
with O
a O
group O
of O
6 O
, O
so O
we O
ordered O
almost O
every O
item O
on O
their O
menu O
. O

Other O
than O
the O
queue O
and O
the O
slow O
service O
, O
nothing O
is O
bad O
about O
here O
to O
me O
. O

^ O
^ O
give O
me O
anything O
with O
yam O
and O
i'll O
devour O
it O
hehe O
:D O
it O
was O
a O
lovely O
smooth O
puree O
that O
was O
relatively O
light O
( O
good O
, O
especially O
since O
we O
were O
already O
so O
full O
from O
the O
dim O
sum O
) O
and O
i O
loved O
the O
added O
texture O
of O
the O
sago O
inside O
it O
! O

As O
equivalent O
to O
Xiao B
long I
bao I
size O
! O
! O

Seriously O
, O
they O
wanted O
business O
but O
not O
customers O
, O
hence O
such O
disrespect O
for O
customers O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
find O
the O
food O
quite O
good O
, O
especially O
the O
Baked B
Bun I
with I
BBQ I
Pork I
. O

But O
there O
is O
nothing O
exceptional O
about O
it O
. O

we O
ordered O
13 O
different O
dishes O
, O
most O
of O
which O
were O
pretty O
darn O
good O
. O

The O
time O
which O
we O
waited O
before O
our O
next O
round O
of O
orders O
were O
served O
make O
us O
wonder O
if O
they O
had O
to O
steam O
the O
dim O
sum O
one O
basket O
at O
a O
time O
. O

It O
takes O
a O
while O
for O
dishes O
to O
arrive O
, O
so O
do O
exercise O
caution O
when O
ordering O
in O
between O
dishes O
to O
prevent O
over-ordering O
. O

As O
for O
their O
siew B
mai I
and O
ha B
gao I
( O
shrimp B
dumpling I
) O
, O
I O
am O
not O
fond O
of O
either O
as O
the O
skin O
is O
too O
thick O
for O
both O
. O

We O
had O
so O
many O
favourites O
, O
the O
wasabi B
prawns I
are O
definitely O
a O
highlight O
but O
then O
so O
were O
the O
chicken O
dumplings O
, O
pork O
buns O
and O
desserts O
. O

Loved O
the O
consistency O
of O
the O
lava O
, O
not O
too O
watery O
nor O
too O
lumpy O
. O

siew B
mais I
were O
decent O
too O
. O

Set O
in O
a O
air-conditioned O
coffeshop O
style O
unit O
in O
Sunshine O
Plaza O
, O
the O
place O
was O
packed O
and O
bustling O
by O
the O
time O
we O
got O
there O
but O
thankfully O
we O
did O
not O
have O
to O
wait O
too O
long O
for O
a O
table O
. O

If O
you O
are O
there O
for O
fast O
service O
, O
i O
think O
it O
is O
the O
wrong O
place O
to O
be O
. O

We O
protested O
! O

They O
will O
deliver O
your O
order O
to O
the O
table O
, O
and O
you O
can O
then O
pack O
the O
food O
into O
the O
flimsy O
styrofoam O
boxes O
thrown O
at O
you O
. O

At O
the O
table O
, O
it O
is O
very O
natural O
to O
feel O
lost O
- O
no O
one O
seems O
to O
bother O
about O
you O
, O
and O
the O
dim O
sum O
carts O
take O
forever O
to O
come O
to O
your O
table O
. O

I O
am O
extremely O
fond O
of O
the O
traditional O
Chinese O
ambience O
and O
decor O
of O
Cherry O
Garden O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
peace O
I O
enjoy O
from O
dining O
here O
unlike O
the O
usual O
boisterous O
affair O
of O
Dim O
Sum O
dining O
. O

now O
seriously O
and O
really O
, O
i O
totally O
believe O
that O
maintaining O
the O
standards O
is O
the O
least O
thing O
you O
could O
do O
if O
you O
want O
to O
let O
your O
business O
grow O
. O

everything O
was O
just O
nice O
, O
great O
. O

Crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
soft O
in O
the O
inside O
:) O

Sizeable O
chunks O
of O
sweet O
juicy O
radish O
pan O
fried O
with O
a O
thin O
crunchy O
outer O
layer O
and O
a O
contrasting O
comforting O
softness O
inside O
, O
this O
was O
delectable O
and O
good O
to O
eat O
on O
its O
own O
, O
without O
any O
additional O
condiments O
on O
the O
side O
necessary O
. O

Thanks O
to O
its O
opulent O
design O
of O
oriental O
leanings O
, O
Cherry O
Garden's O
appeal O
is O
immediate O
and O
timeless O
. O

this O
dim O
sum O
place O
is O
hidden O
in O
sunshine O
plaza O
, O
a O
place O
i O
would O
never O
have O
stepped O
in O
if O
not O
for O
the O
hunt O
of O
victor's O
kitchen O
. O

As O
for O
what O
I O
know O
. O

Service O
bad O
but O
expected O
service O
charge O
up O
front O
. O

My O
friends O
found O
it O
too O
salty O
, O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
really O
really O
good O
. O

Strongly O
recommended O
by O
my O
friend's O
mum O
, O
we O
gave O
it O
a O
try O
at O
this O
dim O
sum O
restaurant O
. O

The O
best O
are O
the O
egg B
tarts I
. O

Their O
red B
bean I
paste I
chinese I
style I
pancake I
were O
crispy O
, O
yet O
moist O
and O
not O
too O
sweet O
. O

Food O
, O
my O
dear O
, O
is O
what O
they O
call O
an O
adventure O
! O

Tea O
charged O
at O
$ O
1.40 O
per O
person O
and O
peanuts O
at O
$ O
1 O
per O
table O
. O

Unless O
you O
are O
ready O
to O
wait O
for O
your O
food O
unconditionally O
, O
please O
give O
this O
shop O
a O
miss O
. O

asking O
me O
.. O

That's O
a O
what O
live O
up O
to O
its O
name O
Portugese O
! O

They O
blow O
into O
plastic O
bags O
to O
open O
them O
before O
storing O
takeaways O
orders O
in O
these O
bags O
. O

And O
i O
couldn't O
taste O
the O
difference O
between O
the O
Kurobuta B
Char I
Siew I
Bao I
& O
the O
normal O
one O
from O
Crystal O
Jade O
. O

Just O
a O
note O
that O
the O
portions O
we O
ordered O
were O
for O
individual O
and O
were O
pretty O
paltry O
compared O
to O
the O
normal O
fare O
elsewhere O
. O

Service O
: O
Pretty O
decent O
, O
they O
try O
to O
do O
their O
best O
given O
the O
crowds O
. O

And O
after O
we O
ordered O
, O
they O
immediately O
asked O
if O
we O
also O
wanted O
tea O
. O

my O
partner O
enjoyed O
it O
thoroughly O
, O
especially O
because O
he O
likes O
spring O
onion O
( O
he O
ATE O
all O
the O
spring O
onion O
up O
) O
and O
he O
doesnt O
like O
his O
meat O
so O
tough O
. O

I O
still O
prefer O
CCF B
with O
prawns O
or O
charsiew O
inside O
. O

In O
fact O
they O
are O
so O
pretty O
and O
adorable O
that O
me O
and O
my O
friends O
couldn O
t O
bear O
to O
bite O
into O
them O
. O

As O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dishes O
, O
I O
am O
afraid O
I O
can't O
recall O
much O
even O
though O
I O
was O
there O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
. O

But O
I O
would O
still O
come O
back O
for O
it O
. O

Char B

. O

we O
asked O
for O
carpark O
redemption O
and O
was O
first O
told O
only O
valet O
parking O
could O
be O
redeemed O
. O

The O
sauce O
was O
very O
fragrant O
and O
the O
portion O
was O
just O
nice O
so O
that O
you O
could O
enjoy O
the O
other O
dim O
sum O
. O

But O
I O
would O
rather O
pay O
more O
and O
have O
better O
quality O
dim O
sum O
and O
better O
service O
at O
my O
fav O
dim O
sum O
place O
in O
Paragon O
. O

The O
Prawn B

a O
thin O

semi-translucent O

around O
a O

fresh O

succulent O

sitting O
atop O
a O
small O
mouthful O
of O
vegetables O
. O

SG O
Kopitiam O
is O
better O
. O

Totally O
delicious O
. O

But O
unless O
you O
know O
the O
items O
, O
the O
cooked O
food O
has O
both O
hits O
and O
misses O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
highlight O
of O
the O
Wok-fried B
Baby I
Corn I
and I
Asparagus I
in I
XO I
Sauce I
was O
more O
about O
crunchiness O
as O
the O
Baby O
Corn O
and O
Asparagus O
were O
underwhelmed O
by O
the O
XO O
Sauce O
, O
which O
should O
have O
brought O
a O
distinct O
savory O
touch O
to O
the O
vegetables O
, O
considering O
how O
well O
it O
accompanied O
the O

We O
are O
big O

, O
and O
the O
ones O
served O
here O
are O
definitely O
in O
our O
top O

list O
! O

There O
was O
this O

who O
had O
very O
good O
service O
. O

Glutinous B

( O

Thankfully O
we O
came O
early O
! O

I O
am O
just O
happy O
to O
share O
both O
bowls O
of O
awesomeness O
with O
my O
makan O

. O

In O
general O
, O
we O
will O
not O
visit O
this O
eatery O
again O
. O

No O
2nd O
visit O
for O
me O
... O

The O
service O
is O
good O
, O
but O
the O
fun O
part O
was O
really O
stalking O
and O
hunting O
down O
those O
aunties O
with O
the O
carts O
! O

Has O
expansion O
degraded O
the O
quality O
that O
it O
used O
to O
serve O
during O
so O
many O
past O
visits O
? O

While O
easily O
overlooked O
, O
this O
is O
another O
dish O
that O
we O
found O
rather O
impressive O
and O
could O
not O
stop O
ourselves O
from O
digging O
into O
the O
whole O
time O
. O

Tables O
and O
chairs O
were O
so O
closely O
placed O
that O
you O
had O
to O
share O
a O
long O
table O
with O
other O
parties O
. O

I O
would O
have O
hoped O
that O
the O
Walnut O
Ice O
Cream O
could O
complement O
the O
highlight O
of O
the O
dessert O
even O
better O
but O
I O
guess O
it O
was O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
Cream O
of O
Avocado O
. O

Swee O
Choon O
is O
an O
oldie O
( O
established O
a O
very O
long O
time O
ago O
) O
but O
still O
a O
goodie O
. O

This O
time O
round O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
be O
more O
gungho O
and O
set O
my O
heart O
on O
trying O
an O
off O
- O
the-road O
joint O
called O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
in O
the O
bohemian O
Purvis O
St O
district O
. O

I O
do O
understand O
that O
ribs O
being O
ribs O
do O
not O
have O
much O
meat O
, O
but O
this O
one O
, O
the O
pork O
ribs O
were O
not O
even O
tasteful O
. O

And O
matter-of-factly O
told O
us O
that O
we O
could O
change O
the O
teacup O
. O

The O
food O
is O
consistently O
good O
and O
service O
efficient O
. O

( O
+ O
) O
Adjusted O
to O
my O
liking O
for O
I O
told O
them O
not O
to O
add O
any O
sugar O
. O

MUST O
TRY O
. O

Glutinous B
Rice I
( O

) O
This O
had O
always O
been O
a O
' O
must-try O
' O
on O
our O
dim O
sum O
checklist O
but O
this O
was O
disappointing O
to O
say O
the O
least O
. O

Absolutely O
not O
ready O
to O
seat O
new O
patrons O
. O

The O
la B

was O
springy O
and O
taut O
, O
soaking O
up O
the O
flavours O
of O
the O
spicy O
and O
sour O

. O

Prices O
inclusive O
of O

but O
NO O

ignored O
us O
several O
times O
and O
only O
like O

As O
printed O
on O
their O

The O

At O
this O

we O
were O
just O
fed-up O
with O

we O
said O
it's O
fine O

decided O
to O
leave O

Give O
the O

a O

Many O
times O
we've O
keblakan O
pusing-ed O
because O
the O

was O
too O
crowded O
( O
about O
1030 O

Freshly O

with O
a O
nice O

lots O

Without O

I O
would O

Yes O

the O

used O
to O

so O

happy O
, O
the O
customers O
glad O
to O
find O
such O
a O
cheap O
and O
great O
eatery O
, O
but O
now O
standards O
have O
totally O
dropped O
, O
it O
is O
my O
3rd O
year O
in O
school O
, O
and O
its O
a O
pity O
seeing O
how O
this O
eatery O
have O
changed O
. O

The O
eatery O
you O
see O
now O
is O
actually O
updated O
with O
more O
desserts O
and O
new O
stuff O
, O
the O
desserts O
are O
still O
good O
, O
food O
still O
nice O
, O
if O
you O
can O
ignore O
all O
this O
customer O
service O
, O
and O
hygiene O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
lack O
of O
chili O
sauce O
was O
quite O
a O
taboo O
by O
my O
books O
. O

:( O
Been O
going O
to O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
since O
he O
started O
as O
a O
humber O
little O
shop O
at O
Sunshine O
Plaza O
. O

reasonable O
pricing O
for O
dim O

but O
its O
crowded O
. O

Had O
to O
look O
all O
over O
the O
place O
for O
someone O
to O
clear O
our O
table O
. O

( O

Did O
not O
taste O
any O
scallops O
in O
the O
carrot B

too O
. O

its O
nearer O
to O
walk O
from O
bugis O
mrt O
. O

The O
seasoning O
for O
the O
filling O
was O
different O
, O
with O
this O
being O
sweeter O
and O
even O
appearance O
wise O
, O
too O
' O
artificially O
red O
' O
, O
in O
our O
humble O
opinion O
. O

My O
mom O
and O
i O
actually O
took O
a O
walk O
around O
the O
place O
midway O
through O
the O
meal O
, O
just O
to O
see O
what O
the O
other O
tables O
were O
chomping O
down O
, O
and O
do O
the O
chase O
the O
pushcart O
round O
the O
restaurant O
ritual O
which O
is O
so O
reminiscent O
of O
a O
good O
Hong O
Kong O
holiday O
... O

Tender O

HAHAHA O

Sadly O
speaking O
, O
for O
a O
company O
that O
has O
been O
operating O
for O
5 O
years O
, O
Viktor's O
Kitchen O
has O
never O
managed O
to O
get O
one O
critical O
thing O
right O
: O
The O
human O
factor O
of O
its O
waitstaffs O
. O

They O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
interesting O
items O
coming O
from O
the O
kitchen O
, O
like O
banana B
and I
prawn I
fritters I
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
it O
is O
no O
longer O
worth O
eating O
here O
at O
the O
prices O
they O
charge O
which O
is O
equivalent O
to O
higher O
end O
places O
like O
Lei O
Garden O
and O
Taste O
Paradise O
but O
yet O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
food O
has O
fallen O
to O
an O
all O
time O
low O
. O

Food O
is O
ok O
only O
so O
why O
bother O
going O
? O
Don't O
go O
seriously O
. O

The O
almond O
taste O
is O
very O
overpowering O
. O

Full O
review O
and O
photos O
: O

The O
pork B
ribs I
were O
really O
fatty O
and O
the O
chee B
cheong I
fun I
did O
not O
have O
enough O
sauce O
on O
it O
. O

not O
soggy O
, O
but O
crunchy O
and O
it O
was O
done O
very O
well O
with O
the O
ginger O
and O
garlic O
. O

The O
lady O
who O
took O
our O
orders O
was O
kind O
enough O
to O
serve O
us O
the O
right O
quantity O
of O
each O
item O
based O
on O
the O
number O
of O
people O
present O
( O
you O
know O
how O
some O
restaurants O
are O
so O
sticky O
on O
serving O
their O
dim O
sum O
is O
fixed O
sets O
of O
3 O
) O
, O
which O
impressed O
the O
hell O
out O
of O
me O
. O

The O
ambience O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
absolutely O
lovely O
, O
a O
modern O
take O
on O
a O
more O
traditional O
chinese O
style O
. O

Skin O
of O
the O
duck O
was O
duck O
was O
crispy O
, O
and O
the O
sweetness O
of O
the O
glutinous O
rice O
complemented O
well O
with O
dish O
. O

Among O
all O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
i O
find O
the O
chicken O
( O
forget O
what O
its O
called O
) O
to O
be O
hard O
and O
their O
mango B
pudding I
taste O
rather O
bland O
despite O
their O
generous O
amount O
of O
sour O
mangoes O
= O
x O
. O

Har B
gow I
prawn O
not O
fresh O
, O
skin O
beli O
thick O
too O
. O

Sad O
to O
say O
I O
found O
the O
prices O
to O
have O
escalated O
to O
be O
on O
par O
with O
restaurants O
such O
as O
crystal O
jade O
or O
imperial O
treasure O
. O

The O
brown O
sugar O
malay B
cake I
is O
quite O
nice O
, O
but O
only O
me O
and O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
like O
it O
, O
the O
other O
2 O
of O
my O
friends O
don't O
really O
like O
it O
. O

However O
, O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
service O
here O
. O

That's O
partly O
because O
the O
yellow O
skin O
used O
to O
wrap O
the O
siew O
mai O
often O
taste O
weird O
. O

It O
is O
rather O
Hong O
Kong O
style O
, O
with O
the O
waitresses O
puching O
carts O
selling O
their O
dim O
sum O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
, O
there O
is O
free O
flow O
of O
dessert O
, O
which O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
about O
this O
brunch O
since O
the O
avocado B
dessert I
is O
so O
heavenly O
good O
. O

Perhaps O
some O
birds O
chirping O
would O
have O
really O
completed O
the O
whole O
impression O
. O

The O
jelly O
was O
way O
too O
sour O
and O
made O
me O
cringe O
everytime O
I O
took O
a O
bite O
. O

Each O
item O
arrived O
with O
an O
excruciatingly O
long O
interval O
in O
between O
. O

The O
very O
first O
, O
I O
believed O
. O

But O
this O
, O
this O
is O
different O
. O

Few O
restaurants O
can O
match O
their O
wonderful O
creation O
. O
Wow O
! O

however O
, O
if O
i O
were O
to O
be O
craving O
yam B

, O
there O
is O
a O
coffee O

in O

SUPERB O

( O
the O
entire O
thing O
is O
made O
of O

, O
not O
merely O
little O

) O
, O
so O
having O
eaten O
that O
, O
i O
have O
yet O
to O
be O
impressed O
with O
the O

anywhere O
else O

however O
not O
all O

it O
was O
still O
one O
of O
the O

had O

that O
the O

the O

was O
nice O

nothing O
special O

to O
others O
that O
i've O
tasted O

again O

the O

my O

at O
the O

The O
siew B

were O
well-seasoned O
and O
each O
bite O
was O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
last O
. O

My O
family O

I O
were O
seated O
in O
less O

ten O

as O
a O

( O
( O
It O
was O
a O

The O

good O

but O
not O
exactly O
value-for-money O
as O
it O
is O
pretty O

What O

another O

Another O

that O
you O
will O
not O

It O
tasted O
pretty O
much O

a O

Personally O

I O
don't O
see O
how O
different O
it O

what O

not O

Just O
not O

for O

. O

Porridge O
has O
a O
very O
fine O

which O
could O
have O
done O
better O
, O
perhaps O
with O
more O

. O

Nothing O
memorable O
... O

It O

a O
nice O

. O

Definitely O
one O
of O
their O
must O
tries O
is O
the O
Golden B

. O

For O
some O
reason O
, O
I O
couldn't O
identify O
the O
weird O
taste O
, O
could O
be O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
meat O
filling O
itself O
has O
successfully O
covered O
the O
weird O
taste O
coming O
from O
the O
yellow O
skin O
, O
perhaps O
? O

I O
have O
always O
marveled O
at O
how O
simple O
it O
was O
to O
place O
orders O
during O
the O
ancient O
times O
. O

are O

I O
promptly O
ordered O
another O

probably O
aint O
e O
best O
idea O
coz O
it O
hardened O
up O
when O
i O
reached O

trust O
me O
.. O

My O
husband O
& O
I O
have O
major O
craving O
for O
Victor's O

all O
the O
time O
. O

It's O
great O
to O
know O
there's O
always O
a O

Waved O

a O

, O
she O
saw O
me O
and O
hurriedly O
turned O
away O
. O
Infuriating O
. O

Enough O
has O
been O
written O
about O

: O
but O
if O
you O
were O
a O
har B
gow I
in O
Red O

, O
wouldn't O
you O
want O
a O
thick O

too O
? O

Though O
the O
food O
was O
exquisite O
and O
tasted O
good O
, O
it O
wasn't O
phenomenal O
to O
the O
palate O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
is O
top O
notch O
and O
variety O
was O
good O
, O
you O
can O
have O
the O
hongkong O
like O
yum O
cha O
konda O
feeling O
. O

The O
sauce O
is O
wonderful O
. O

The O
relish O
of O
the O
beef O
was O
more O
prominent O
than O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
gravy O
itself O
, O
while O
once O
again O
, O
the O
spicy O
flavor O
of O
onions O
and O
gingers O
is O
not O
too O
significant O
. O

Frist O
impressions O
... O

Get O
a O
pot O
of O
chrysanthemum O

to O
go O
with O
your O
food O
. O

Kudos O
too O
to O
the O

. O

No O
ambience O
to O
speak O
of O
unless O
you O
like O
the O
smell O
of O
back O
alleys O
... O

If O
you O
ever O
wonder O
how O
traditional O
Dim O
Sum O
is O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
? O

Sweet O
, O
fragrant O
with O
no O
sharp O
or O
bitter O
after-taste O
and O
I O
don't O
feel O
thirsty O
even O
after O
drinking O
it O
. O

Well O
, O
like O
others O
have O
mentioned O
. O

It's O
simple O
and O
yet O
many O
restaurants O
nowadays O
can't O
even O
handle O
a O
simple O
dish O
like O
this O
! O

Chicken B
feet I
fell O
flat O
as O
well O
in O
trerms O
of O
flavour O
. O

and O
she O
rudely O
bang O
the O
teapot O
cover O
back O
to O
its O
position O
before O
taking O
the O
pot O
away O
. O

Now O
for O
the O
food O
proper O
, O
you O
can O
cross-reference O
to O
the O
previous O
post O
on O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
, O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

By O
that O
, O
i O
was O
referring O
to O
the O
same O
dishes O
. O

My O
recommended O
dishes O
are O
definitely O
the O
OX O
carrot B
cake I
( O
steamed O
and O
not O
fried O
) O
, O
their O
beancurd B
prawn I
roll I
and O
last O
but O
not O
least O
their O
sinful O
lava B
bun I
! O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
this O
place O
is O
cleaner O
, O
brighter O
& O
more O
organised O
now O
. O

I O
think O
I O
wasn't O
worth O
the O
hype O
consider O
that O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
overpriced O
for O
dim O
sum O
, O
for O
the O
amount O
we O
paid O
, O
I O
assume O
that O
we O
could O
eat O
the O
whole O
restaurant O
down O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

Oh O
, O
and O
if O
you're O
the O
kind O
of O
person O
with O
plenty O
of O
time O
on O
your O
hands O
and O
who O
thinks O
nothing O
of O
spending O
half O
an O
hour O
in O
line O
for O
mostly O
average O
dim O
sum O
, O
be O
my O
guest O
. O

It O
was O
too O
starchy O
and O
the O
sauce O
was O
too O
thick O
. O

An O
excited O
me O
immediately O
called O
the O
restaurant O
to O
see O
if O
it's O
open O
. O

If O
you O
like O
your O
food O
sweet O
and O
your O
spicing O
bland O
, O
this O
is O
the O
dim O
sum O
place O
for O
you O
. O

it O
was O
enough O
, O
perhaps O
this O
was O
too O
much O
for O
them O
to O
handle O
. O

If O
you O
are O
really O
out O
for O
authentic O
Dim O
Sum O
with O
an O
old O
world O
charm O
ambience O
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

Nor O
do O
they O
display O
exemplary O
customer O
service O
either O
. O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
are O
still O
adamant O
on O
trying O
this O
place O
, O
it O
is O
best O
for O
you O
to O
walk O
around O
with O
the O
paper-card O
, O
looking O
for O
the O
food O
you O
want O
. O

Wise O
Guy O
sez O
dat O
last O
time O
standard O
gooder O
, O
coz O
his O
ex O
stays O
here O
and O
he O
used O
to O
eatzi O
here O
often O
. O

Being O
a O
Liu B
Sha I
Bao I
fan O
, O
I O
thought O
this O
was O
pretty O
good O
. O

Food's O
average O
and O
pretty O
standard O
... O
guess O
the O
highlight O
is O
that O
they O
have O
the O
vegetable O
where O
you O
cook O
( O
i O
) O
soup O
or O
( O
ii O
) O
fry O
with O
the O
3 O
types O
of O
eggs O
, O
using O
its O
leaves O
on O
a O
thorny O
stalk O
... O
they O
have O
both O
versions O
I O
think O
, O
which O
is O
really O
good O
! O

we O
also O
ordered O
the O
char B
siew I
hor I
fun I
, O
but O
it O
didn't O
seem O
to O
taste O
as O
good O
as O
the O
you B
tiao I
cheong I
fun I
. O

Normally O
people O
go O
Red O
Star O
for O
dim O
sum O
but O
I O
prefer O
their O
authentic O
Cantonese O
food O
. O

I O
have O
to O
however O
, O
disclaim O
that O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
try O
the O
original O
one O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
so O
I'm O
not O
sure O
how O
it O
matches O
up O
! O

Only O
their O
dried B
vegetable I
soup I
seems O
watery O
and O
tastes O
flat O
;p O
ossibly O
because O
the O
stock O
is O
running O
low O
, O
and O
water O
is O
added O
to O
make O
up O
the O
volumn O
. O

But O
makes O
up O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
less O
commercialized O
taste O
, O
and O
Hongkong O
movie-set-from-the O
- O
70s O
- O
vibe O
. O

Despite O
thinking O
I O
don't O
like O
it O
all O
that O
much O
, O
I O
can't O
seem O
to O
resist O
having O
one O
every O
time O
my O
parents O
buy O
it O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
, O
so O
delicately O
craft O
piece O
by O
piece O
, O
was O
an O
art O
, O
for O
all O
to O
enjoyed O
. O

I'm O
hungry O
already O
. O

We O
also O
ordered O
the O
Prawn B
and I
Banana I
Fritter I
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
think O
the O
main O
draw O
of O
this O
place O
is O
its O
opening O
hours O
( O
till O
3am O
) O
and O
also O
it's O
proximity O
to O
Mustafa O
. O

But O
in O
exchange O
for O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
the O
dimsum O
isn't O
compromised O
, O
so O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
fair O
trade-off O
to O
me O
. O

Went O
for O
the O
1st O
seating O
11am O
- O
1pm O
. O

Environment O
ok O
as O
the O
air O
con O
not O
too O
cold O
& O
table O
seating O
spacious O
. O

When O
we O
insisted O
to O
take O
a O
closer O
look O
, O
she O
unhappily O
passed O
it O
to O
me O
. O

A O
waste O
of O
3 O
bucks O
, O
kindly O
ignore O
this O
if O
you O
ever O
go O
to O
Victor O
s O
. O

The O
skin O
was O
as O
crispy O
as O
one O
you O
would O
expect O
from O
a O
roast O
sucking O
pig O
. O

garden O
has O
a O
modern O
interpretation O
of O
a O
traditional O
chinese O
inn O
, O
mixing O
ultra-modern O
glass O
paneling O
and O
stone O
walls O
with O
traditional O
elements O
like O
wooden O
arches O
and O
pavilion-styled O
roofs O
. O

I O
find O
that O
it O
is O
still O
not O
the O
best O
that O
i O
have O
ever O
came O
across O
Dim O
sum O
is O
my O
all O
time O
favourate O
so O
my O
expectation O
is O
higher O
.. O

If O
not O
because O
of O
the O
limit O
order O
, O
I O
would O
have O
taken O
away O
more O
than O
one O
set O
of O
buns O
, O
because O
they O
are O
really O
too O
great O
. O

As O
for O
the O
dim O
sum O
I'm O
probably O
more O
inclined O
to O
head O
to O
Geylang O
. O

i O
ordered O
one O
whole O
plate O
for O
myself O
okay O
:p O
which O
is O
three O
pieces O
. O

Our O
group O
of O
ten O
went O
there O
recently O
on O
a O
Saturday O
evening O
, O
having O
not O
been O
there O
for O
some O
years O
. O

But O
can O
be O
kinda O
pricey O
so O
unless O
you O
have O
dough O
( O
lots O
of O
it O
) O
just O
go O
ocassionally O
. O

That O
day's O
service O
was O
exceptionally O
good O
and O
efficient O
. O

One O
disappointment O
was O
the O
beef B
ball I
with I
bean I
curd I
skin I
though O
- O
didn't O
like O
the O
flavour O
of O
the O
herbs O
put O
inside O
there O
. O

To O
order O
, O
you O
will O
need O
to O
get O
the O
order O
slip O
( O
menu O
) O
from O
the O
counter O
along O
with O
a O
pencil O
and O
tick O
the O
items O
along O
with O
the O
quantity O
you O
want O
. O

That's O
a O
plus O
point O
for O
them O
:) O

Afterwhich O
we O
headed O
to O
Jalan O
Besar O
for O
Swee O
Choon O
Dimsum O
. O

We O
made O
reservation O
for O
the O
2nd O
seating O
which O
is O
from O
1.30 O
pm O
to O
3pm O
. O

The O
portion O
of O
prawn O
to O
pork O
is O
actually O
very O
low O
, O
so O
not O
much O
of O
prawn O
taste O
, O
its O
the O
more O
porky O
kind O
. O

Right O
here O
, O
I've O
finally O
found O
one O
that O
doesn't O
have O
that O
weird O
taste O
anymore O
. O

For O
century O
egg O
, O
add O
SGD O
1 O
. O

Verdict O
: O
7.5 O
/ O
10 O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
dim O
sum O
, O
we O
have O
an O
exceptionally O
high O
standard O
for O
it O
is O
one O
of O
our O
favourite O
dining O
options O
. O

Crystal O
Jade O
upstairs O
is O
so O
much O
better O
. O

I O
wished O
they O
could O
have O
stick O
with O
what O
they O
used O
to O
serve O
. O

Egg B
tarts I
are O
tasty O
and O
go O
well O
with O
Chinese O
tea O
. O

So O
I O
guess O
I O
am O
really O
lucky O
this O
time O
. O

I O
think O
this O
might O
possibly O
be O
what O
s O
known O
as O
proper O
hong O
kong O
style O
with O
a O
spartan O
piece O
of O
white O
paper O
to O
mark O
your O
orders O
from O

The O
Wasabi B

and O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
wasabi O
really O
complemented O
the O
prawn O
. O

It O
would O
be O
safe O
to O
say O
that O
the O
average O
waiting O
time O
to O
get O
a O
seat O
would O
be O
2 O
hours O
. O

The O
har B
gow I
is O
exceptionally O
good O
- O
the O
skin O
is O
firm O
yet O
thin O
and O
the O
dumpling O
is O
bursting O
with O
whole O
prawns O
. O

He O
even O
got O
a O
non-egg O

to O
try O

like O
it O

Oh O

the O

abit O
too O
oily O
and O
slightly O

( O
- O
) O
Largely O
disappointed O
as O
it O
was O
nowhere O
close O
to O
the O
Queen O

stated O
in O
the O
menu O
. O

Really O
really O
bad O
. O

We O
loved O
all O
the O

very O
fresh O
and O
especially O
the O
Siew B

Shrimp B

we O
had O

When O
we O

take O
a O

, O
she O
refused O
initially O

Nicely O

from O
the O

. O

In O
between O
, O
we O
had O
a O

which O
I O
absolutely O
can O

remember O
its O

good O

We O
asked O
for O
a O

and O
they O
said O
there O
wasnt O
any O

so O
we O
were O

it O
looked O

but O
once O

We O
had O

The O
high O

in O
most O
dim O

suggested O
it O
being O
a O

extremely O
disappointing O
. O

The O

that O

no O

I O
have O
never O

And O
apart O
from O
loving O
the O

and O
the O

, O
I O
really O
love O
the O

Ah O

I O

2 O

I O
just O

for O

. O

Crystal O
Jade O
restaurant O
is O
just O
upstairs O
so O
save O
yourself O
the O
trouble O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favourite O
because O
I O
have O
not O
eaten O
anything O
like O
it O
elsewhere O
. O

We O
dont O
have O
anything O
. O

For O
details O
and O
pictures O
of O
food O
: O

the O
price O
is O
quite O
cheap O
compare O
to O
other O
dim O
sum O
restaurant O
but O
the O
food O
is O
still O
delicious O
! O
! O
! O

its O
an O
occupational O
hazard O
. O

You O
get O
the O
hong O
kong O
yum O
cha O
feeling O
and O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
wait O
in O
line O
for O
way O
too O
long O
. O

The O
waiters O
were O
very O
attentive O
, O
but O
the O
service O
of O
food O
was O
quite O
slow O
which O
lead O
me O
to O
over-ordering O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
like O
I O
said O
earlier O
, O
You O
have O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
, O
to O
appreciate O
what O
you O
are O
getting O
all O
these O
time O
. O

drinks O
come O
in O
old O
school O
pyrex O
and O
glass O
dishes O
, O
and O
the O
dimsum O
arrive O
in O
weathered O
bamboo O
steams O
all O
of O
which O
elicit O
a O
sort O
of O
rusticity O
amidst O
the O
old-school O
decor O
. O

We O
also O
tried O
the O

You O
should O
be O
more O
adventurous O
and O
try O
the O
more O
unique O
stuff O
, O
coz O
the O
common O
things O
( O
siewmai B
, O
charsiewpao I
) O
are O
average O
only O
. O

The O
flavour O
was O
comparable O
to O
Din O
Tai O
Fung's O
but O
loses O
out O
in O
the O
texture O
of O
the O
chicken O
and O
chosen O
parts O
. O

As O
there O
is O
only O
2 O
hours O
for O
the O
buffet O
for O
each O
seating O
, O
I O
would O
say O
that O
time O
is O
pretty O
tight O
considering O
that O
there O
is O
so O
much O
to O
order O
and O
try O
from O
the O
extensive O
Dim O
Sum O
menu O
. O

Like O
their O
beef B
stomach I
soup I
and O
HK B
style I
porridge I
~ O
also O
like O
their O
Siew B
mai I
:) O

The O
single O
item O
that O
I O
must O
say O
is O
nice O
, O
is O
their O
in O
house O
sichuan O
special O
sauce O
. O

The O
Fried B
Prawn I
Dumplings I
were O
crunchy O
on O
the O
outside O
without O
being O
oily O
and O
filled O
with O
a O
chockful O
of O
succulent O
prawn O
bits O
. O

the O
table O
beside O
us O
also O
complained O
about O
the O
sourness O
. O

i'd O
note O
though O
that O
i O
found O
no O
relevance O
between O
the O
two O
dishes O
that O
were O
plated O
together O
- O
its O
not O
as O
though O
we're O
expected O
to O
eat O
both O
together O
, O
which O
is O
something O
you O
would O
assume O
if O
you O
found O
yourself O
in O
a O
french O
restaurant O
. O

the O
skin O
was O
a O
tad O
thick O
but O
it O
s O
sufficiently O
soft O
, O
while O
the O
filling O
was O
juicy O
with O
tender O
meat O
. O

Other O
ingredients O
not O
captured O
on O
camera O
include O
dried O
oyster O
roll O
, O
Chinese O
sausage O
, O
and O
dace O
fillet O
. O

We O
were O
served O
with O
the O
Crisp-Fried B
Marinated I
Duck I
stuffed I
with I
Glutinous I
Rice I
which O
was O
simply O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

I O
felt O
that O
they O
were O
very O
disorganised O
. O

The O
service O
of O
the O
restaurant O
is O
quite O
poor O
as O
the O
waiters O
/ O
waitresses O
are O
busy O
rushing O
around O
. O

It O
is O
gratifying O
to O
make O
people O
envious O
by O
retelling O
how O
good O
the O
food O
and O
experience O
was O
at O
Red O
Star O
. O

During O
this O
visit O
, O
I O
ordered O
my O
erstwhile O
favourites O
: O
1 O
. O

So O
, O
it O
was O
a O
Friday O
night O
and O
my O
good O
friend O
Mike O
is O
in O
town O
. O

For O
me O
, O
Red O
Star O
whiffs O
of O
family O
gatherings O
, O
little O
joys O
during O
childhood O
and O
sense O
of O
comfort O
. O

on O
asking O
then O
say O
50 O
cent O
only O
very O
cheap O
just O
let O
it O
be O
. O

very O
nice O
However O
the O
carrot B
cake I
with I
xo I
and O
the O
har B
gow I
not O
that O
nice O
... O

Otherwise O
, O
feel O
free O
to O
furnish O
me O
with O
comments O
, O
may O
it O
be O
positive O
or O
negative O
: O

Their O
dim O

is O
damm O
good O
especially O
their O
Feng B

. O

FOUR O
BUCKS O
FOR O
A O
LONG O
OF O
SIEW B
MAI I
AND O
EVERYTHING O
ELSE O
? O
? O
? O

It O
was O
refreshingly O
good O
! O

Dumpling O
skin O
is O
kinda O
thick O
to O
me O
. O

. O

Indgredients O
were O
also O
generous O
with O
huge O
chunks O
of O
century O
egg O
and O
big O
pieces O
of O
chicken O
strips O
. O

The O
soup O
tasted O
like O
essence O
of O
chicken O
.. O

I O
didn't O
like O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
fillings O
, O
it O
was O
flat O
. O

and O
that's O
the O
first O
impression O
on O
walking O
into O
Red O
Star O
on O
a O
weekday O
afternoon O
as O
a O
first O
timer O
after O
hearing O
so O
many O
reviews O
about O
it O
. O

The O
chee B
chong I
fun I
is O
not O
good O
, O
thick O
and O
not O
smooth O
enough O
. O

Apparently O
, O
this O
was O
not O
any O
restaurant O
serving O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
the O
first O
overseas O
branch O
of O
a O
Michelin O
Star O
dim O
sum O
restaurant O
from O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

For O
the O
food O
here O
, O
it O
may O
require O
up O
to O
2 O
hour O
long O
queue O
. O

We O
also O
loved O
the O
ambient O
music O
while O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
meal O
. O

It O
was O
pan-fried O
to O
a O
crisp O
on O
the O
outside O
yet O
it O
was O
moist O
and O
flavorful O
inside O
. O

First O
off O
: O
During O
the O
ordering O
, O
because O
the O
menu O
was O
really O
that O
extensive O
, O
I O
hesitated O
at O
points O
. O

The O
Double B
- I
boiled I
Fish I
Broth I
with I
Pak I
Choy I
, I
Fish I
Maw I
and I
Tofu I
appeared O
to O
be O
a O
rather O
light O
dish O
but O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
Fish O
Maw O
, O
it O
had O
a O
rather O
overwhelming O
fishy O
taste O
which O
caused O
the O
dish O
to O
be O
not O
as O
enjoyable O
. O

Food O
came O
quickly O
, O
service O
was O
rather O
quick O
. O

It's O
good O
to O
eat O
with O
rice O
. O

The O
cheong O
fun O
coating O
was O
ordinary O
. O

Is O
it O
worth O
the O
wait O
? O

Service O
was O
okay O
. O

Ambience O
: O
It O
started O
off O
as O
2 O
shoplots O
and O
now O
it O
occupies O
4 O
shoplots O
, O
all O
clustered O
together O
. O

Worth O
trying O
! O

in O
fact O
, O
he O
liked O
it O
so O
much O
, O
he O
finished O
both O
. O

Anyways O
these O
are O
all O
the O
food O
I O
can O
recall O
. O

Nice O
supper O
place O
for O
people O
who O
hang O
around O
Petain O
/ O
Desker O
JWNY O
Found O
myself O
craving O
for O
some O
salted B
egg I
yolk I
custard I
bun I
( O
Liu B
Sha I
Bao I
) O
. O

It's O
kinda O
popular O
with O
the O
chinese O
as O
they O
have O
wide O
extensive O
of O
food O
and O
reasonable O
prices O
. O

:) O

Enjoyed O
the O
custard B
bun I
, O
chee B
choong I
fun I
, O
chicken B
wings I
, O
mee B
sua I
kueh I
and O
many O
more O
! O
! O
! O

A O
few O
dishes O
were O
hot O
. O

However O
, O
the O
beancurd O
skin O
really O
had O
a O
VERY O
beancurd O
taste O
. O

So O
we O
were O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
for O
dinner O
in O
Sunshine O
plaza O
and O
was O
happy O
it O
was O
half O
full O
( O
near O
closing O
time O
) O
on O
a O
sunday O
evening O
... O

the O
wasabi B
prawns I
were O
big O
and O
juicy O
, O
bursting O
with O
flavor O
and O
with O
just O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
wasabi O
that O
was O
not O
too O
overpowering O
. O

Cherry O
Garden O
has O
the O
weekend O
dim O
sum O
ala O
carte O
buffet O
at O
$ O
45 O
per O
head O
, O
which O
has O
a O
selections O
of O
20 O
over O
dim O
sum O
, O
and O
other O
Chinese O
food O
as O
well O
. O

the O
use O
of O
herbal O
jelly O
and O
aloe O
vera O
is O
kinda O
unique O
. O

Very O
popular O
with O
folks O
to O
hold O
small O
functions O
. O

You O
want O
butter O
, O
eat O
it O
. O

I O
only O
like O
the O
egg B
tarts I
. O

We O
ended O
up O
very O
full O
, O
the O
food O
was O
cooked O
to O
perfection O
but O
feel O
that O
the O
price O
is O
a O
little O
on O
the O
steep O
side O
. O

Victor O
used O
to O
take O
such O
pride O
in O
his O
offerings O
and O
Victor's O
used O
to O
serve O
some O
of O
the O
best O
tim O
sum O
around O
. O

I O
don't O
see O
any O
noodle O
cart O
, O
spring O
rolls O
, O
Chiu O
Chow O
Fun O
Kuo O
, O
soup O
dumplings O
. O

Regards O
to O
food O
wise O
, O
I O
would O
say O
normal O
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
we O
also O
tried O
some O
of O
their O
signature O
dishes O
like O
baked B
escagot I
, O
wasabi B
prawn I
, O
peking B
duck I
and O
avocado B
cream I
. O

so O
the O
advice O
is O
do O
not O
visit O
the O
shop O
during O
peak O
hours O
. O

Loved O
how O
the O
crackling-crispy O
thin O
skin O
of O
Spring B
Roll I
with I
Egg I
White I
went O
well O
together O
with O
its O
filling O
of O
succulent O
prawns O
, O
egg O
white O
and O
chopped O
carrots O
. O

Service O
wise O
is O
quite O
fast O
despite O
of O
the O
crowd O
. O

Which O
is O
not O
really O
the O
point O
, O
yes O
? O

who O
says O
the O
world O
isn't O
just O
slightly O
fair O
? O

Their O
food O
pales O
in O
comparison O
to O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
or O
even O
the O
Fortune O
Restaurant O
tim O
sum O
at O
Food O
Republic O
. O

For O
me O
, O
I O
never O
even O
patron O
this O
eatery O
, O
when O
I O
was O
at O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

Other O
dishes O
were O
fairly O
good O
as O
well O
. O

Har B
Gau I
Siew B
Mai I
. O
Thumbs O
up O
to O
the O
Har B
Gau I
here O
, O
a O
big O
prawn O
inside O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
Har B
Gau I
. O

And O
i O
liked O
how O
it O
went O
nicely O
with O
the O
sauce O
. O

The O
food O
was O
mediocre O
as O
well O
. O

Overall O
, O
things O
were O
worth O
what O
you O
paid O
for O
. O

I O
have O
ordered O
takeaway O
food O
but O
they O
served O
for O
dine O
in O
, O
I O
requested O
for O
them O
to O
pack O
it O
but O
they O
just O
pass O
me O
some O
foam O
boxes O
and O
expect O
us O
to O
pack O
ourselves O
. O

The O
taste O
was O
still O
the O
same O
as O
I O
tried O
when O
I O
was O
young O
with O
my O
grand O
ma O
. O

Usually O
it O
is O
very O
quiet O
but O
i O
just O
beat O
the O
supper O
crowd O
whilst O
doing O
my O
review O
for O
my O
fans O
... O

Oh O
, O
decadence O
! O

the O
milk B
tea I
that O
we O
ordered O
was O
served O
in O
a O
bowl O
filled O
with O
ice O
. O

And O
then O
she O
will O
chop O
a O
stamp O
on O
your O
billing O
card O
. O

The O
yam B
cake I
was O
quite O
nice O
, O
with O
chunks O
of O
yam O
inside O
. O

The O
place O
is O
posh O
and O
there's O
quite O
a O
few O
service O
staff O
but O
they O
are O
not O
generally O
smilely O
although O
they O
are O
helpful O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
giving O
recommendations O
. O

Only O
thing O
is O
that O
there O
is O
sometimes O
Wayang O
during O
dinner O
time O
which O
is O
not O
conducive O
if O
you O
bring O
babies O
along O
... O

Sorry O
sharky O
! O

The O
Scallop O
, O
Sausage O
Carrot B
Cake I
with I
XO I
Sauce I
was O
fantastic O
! O

that O
is O
what O
we O
did O
, O
and O
i O
enjoyed O
almost O
all O
of O
the O
dishes O
in O
front O
of O
me O
. O

they O
are O
not O
those O
vocal O
persons O
but O
their O
actions O
speak O
a O
lot O
... O

Though O
the O
portions O
are O
a O
tad O
too O
small O
for O
my O
liking O
( O
this O
works O
for O
those O
with O
smaller O
appetites O
/ O
if O
you O
want O
to O
try O
a O
bit O
of O
everything O
) O
, O
the O
food O
is O
great O
so O
I O
guess O
I O
can't O
complain O
. O

Three O
other O
outlets O
have O
sprung O
up O
in O
just O
one O
year O
following O
the O
launch O
of O
the O
flagship O
at O
Plaza O
Singapura O
in O
April O
2013 O
. O

This O
place O
has O
a O
nostalgic O
feeling O
where O
you O
can O
hardly O
find O
it O
in O
Singapore O
nowadays O
. O

they O
are O
extremely O
loud O
, O
rude O
and O
full O
of O
vulgarities O
. O

amazing O
! O

I O
dint O
know O
that O
the O
first O
level O
of O
sunshine O
plaza O
would O
have O
so O
many O
things O
to O
eat O
. O

I O
like O
the O
concept O
of O
Red O
Star O
having O
waitresses O
going O
around O
the O
restaurant O
pushing O
carts O
of O
dim O
sum O
and O
other O
foods O
to O
diners O
' O
tables O
. O

taste O
, O
u O
just O
know O
its O
freshly O
made O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
i O
go O
for O
dim O
sum O
here O
is O
the O
hongkong O
like O
yum O
cha O
feeling O
. O

Another O
( O
Y O
) O
arm O
of O
this O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
outlet O
is O
that O
: O
TAKEAWAY O
COUNTER O
: O
Amidst O
the O
busy O
schedules O
of O
Singaporeans O
, O
a O
take-away O
counter O
has O
been O
erected O
to O
counter O
the O
problem O
of O
time O
shortage O
. O

ambience O
and O
service O
wise O
, O
don't O
expect O
anything O
special O
, O
its O
coffeeshop O
standard O
, O
but O
the O
value O
and O
quality O
of O
the O
food O
more O
than O
make O
up O
for O
itthey O
have O
weird O
opening O
hours O
, O
they O
close O
on O
tuesday O
and O
open O
6pm O
to O
10am O
, O
so O
i O
cant O
have O
my O
dim O
sum O
at O
the O
regular O
11am O
+ O
hours O
during O
weekends O
, O
making O
it O
more O
of O
a O
supper O
place O
overall O
, O
i O
strongly O
recommend O
swee O
choon O
as O
one O
of O
the O
top O
places O
to O
have O
supper O
i O
have O
eaten O
a O
lot O
of O
dim O
sum O
in O
HK O
and O
Shanghai O
but O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
have O
eaten O
for O
sure O
! O

Not O
too O
bad O
:) O

Used O
to O
be O
quite O
delicious O
but O
now O
, O
the O
quality O
is O
lacking O
. O

It O
was O
beautiful O
, O
too O
beautiful O
to O
eat O
. O

Tried O
few O
choices O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
and O
below O
are O
those O
which O
i O
think O
taste O
quite O
good O
. O

I O
like O
the O
dim O
sum O
with O
the O
trolley O
pushing O
around O
looking O
for O
customers O
. O

My O
appreciation O
to O
Kelly O
, O
the O
PR O
relations O
manager O
for O
hosting O
us O
, O
and O
Cuisine O
& O
Wine O
Asia O
for O
the O
invitation O
. O

At O
some O
point O
of O
time O
( O
2 O
+ O
pm O
) O
, O
we O
wanted O
more O
food O
, O
but O
there O
were O
no O
food O
carts O
in O
sight O
. O

See O
all O
my O
pictures O
here O
. O

People O
just O
stood O
in O
a O
line O
out O
of O
no O
where O
outside O
the O
shop O
. O

Having O
numerous O
experiences O
as O
a O
dim O
sum O
chef O
, O
Victor O
and O
his O
wife O
moved O
to O
Singapore O
from O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

! O

I O
will O
highly O
recommend O
Cherry O
Garden O
s O
charcoal-roasted O
BBQ O
meat O
platter O
( O
) O
. O

2 O
. O

Try O
the O
Salted B
egg I
custard I
bun I
, O
one O
of O
my O
favorites O
here O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
red B
bean I
pancake I
. O

The O
skin O
of O
the O
Victor O
s O
King B
prawn I
dumpling I
is O
rather O
thin O
, O
and O
the O
prawns O
inside O
looked O
like O
its O
going O
to O
burst O
out O
anytime O
. O

Oooooh O
thinking O
about O
it O
makes O
me O
hungry O
! O

like O
the O
yinyong O
which O
is O
more O
of O
milk B
tea I
taste O
I O
used O
to O
be O
a O
fan O
of O
Victor's O
kitchen O
and O
is O
one O
of O
the O
first O
batch O
of O
regular O
customers O
. O

! O

The O
place O
is O
dated O
and O
is O
showing O
its O
age O
, O
but O
the O
food O
is O
good O
and O
the O
place O
is O
great O
for O
a O
simple O
, O
relaxed O
Sunday O
lunch O
. O

The O
usually O
bland O
eggplant O
is O
delightfully O
crispy O
, O
and O
the O
floss O
adds O
a O
nice O
salty O
edge O
. O

So O
would O
highly O
recommend O
it O
. O

This O
place O
is O
quite O
busy O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
i O
went O
on O
a O
weekday O
morning O
, O
so O
could O
find O
seats O
easily O
for O
my O
family O
of O
5 O
. O

This O
is O
a O
must O
order O
dish O
for O
me O
whenever O
I'm O
having O
dimsum O
. O

Inside O
seatings O
are O
limited O
, O
we O
even O
have O
shared O
table O
with O
others O
. O

Compared O
to O
their O
Golden B
Egg I
Yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
, O
the O
Yummy B
Milky I
Custard I
Bun I
( O
$ O
3.50 O
) O
taste O
lighter O
but O
nonetheless O
still O
yummy O
. O

The O
tofu B
with I
pork I
floss I
was O
really O
good O
too O
. O

But O
that O
didn't O
bring O
our O
spirits O
low O
, O
because O
we O
were O
determined O
to O
have O
the O
supposedly O
best O
dimsum O
, O
and O
the O
current O
trend O
now O
. O

I O
really O
love O
the O
texture O
of O
the O
buns O
! O

I O
had O
it O
hot O
and O
I O
don't O
find O
it O
especially O
nice O
. O

All O
four O
of O
us O
had O
the O
Chilled B
Cream I
of I
Mango I
with I
Sago I
Pearls I
, I
Pomelo I
and I
Lime I
Sorbet I
. O

He O
couldn't O
accept O
this O
kind O
of O
fusion O
food O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
uncle O
who O
brought O
us O
food O
was O
completely O
civil O
, O
responding O
in O
kind O
when O
we O
thanked O
him O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
very O
big O
and O
can O
accommodate O
several O
large O
groups O
of O
people O
. O

Must O
try O
! O

The O
attitude O
is O
the O
worst O
I O
have O
seen O
. O

Truly O
commendable O
! O
! O

The O
dessert O
boasted O
an O
intense O
milk O
taste O
and O
it O
grew O
on O
one O
with O
each O
spoonful O
of O
quivering O
pudding O
. O

Delicate O
, O
moist O
and O
soft O
, O
this O
Steamed B
Egg I
Cake I
$ O
3.80 O
was O
easily O
one O
of O
my O
favourites O
. O

but O
i O
must O
definitely O
b O
in O
e O
slow O
group O
coz O
e O
thai O
transvestites O
i O
saw O
here O
looked O
like O
regulars O
wheras O
moi O
a O
local O
oni O
juz O
came O
to O
know O
of O
this O
place O
? O

My O
friend O
realised O
that O
the O
xiao B
long I
bao I
was O
sour O
and O
turned O
bad O
, O
so O
we O
complained O
to O
their O
service O
staff O
. O

it O
was O
a O
small O
place O
& O
i O
could O
see O
the O
manager O
taking O
an O
inordinately O
long O
time O
to O
come O
over O
after O
adjusting O
table O
cloth O
etc O
for O
an O
empty O
table O
( O
quite O
unnecessarily O
) O
. O

review O

: O

Dim O
sum O
are O
yummy O
and O
good O
value O
for O
money O
. O

The O
honeydew B
sago I
was O
so O
so O
but O
the O
healtiest O
of O
all O
cos O
it O
does O
not O
contain O
coconut O
. O

Many O
atimes O
I've O
eaten O
those O
with O
too O
much O
pepper O
. O

felt O
like O
stuffing O
the O
money O
on O
my O
hand O
to O
her O
mouth O
to O
keep O
her O
mouth O
shut O
. O

Only O
the O
1st O
part O
about O
the O
long O
queues O
is O
true O
as O
there O
was O
no O
SMS O
system O
nor O
takeaway O
counter O
to O
be O
seen O
when O
I O
went O
there O
on O
31 O
May O
( O
Friday O
) O
at O
2pm O
. O

That O
is O
abit O
too O
exorbitant O
! O

Have O
tim-sum O
also O
. O

The O
limelight O
goes O
to O
la B
mian I
in I
fried I
onion I
oil I
sauce I
. O

Miss O
out O
the O
other O
must O
order O
dish O
mention O
by O
Pokka O
, O
the O
egg B
tarts I
! O
! O

a O
healthy O
way O
of O
ended O
a O
sumptuous O
meal O
. O

the O
salted B
egg I
dumpling I
didnt O
taste O
anything O
like O
salted O
egg O
though O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
here O
is O
amazingly O
good O
and O
my O
favourite O
one O
is O
the O
egg B
tarts I
! O

Because O
the O
tables O
and O
chairs O
are O
so O
closely O
clustered O
together O
, O
it O
makes O
it O
quite O
a O
challenge O
to O
maneuver O
your O
way O
between O
the O
tables O
when O
getting O
the O
order O
papers O
and O
making O
payment O

Finally O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
dine O
at O
Cherry O
Garden O
with O
my O
family O
for O
the O
first O
time O
last O
weekend O
. O

I O
daresay O
it'll O
be O
a O
long O
time O
before O
I O
go O
back O
to O
Red O
Star O
. O

We O
plan O
to O
go O
there O
once O
a O
month O
. O

My O
dear O
, O
the O
netted B
rice I
crispy I
turnover I
. O

The O
price O
here O
is O
pretty O
affordable O
by O
restaurant O
standards O
. O

Something O
like O
vegetable O
dumpling O
? O

It O
wasn't O
soggy O
, O
and O
most O
importantly O
, O
it O
didn't O
reeked O
of O
the O
foul O
pork O
smell O
which O
we O
both O
hate O
. O

It O
is O
similar O
in O
appearance O
to O
a O
charsiew O
polo O
bun O
but O
the O
taste O
is O
nothing O
compared O
to O
it O
. O

The O
dessert O
was O
ok O
but O
abit O
too O
sweet O
for O
my O
liking O
. O

After O
1 O
hour O
, O
we O
finally O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
seat O
inside O
which O
we O
had O
to O
share O
tables O
with O
others O
. O

SORRY O
VICTOR O
but O
i O
feel O
your O
food O
cant O
make O
it O
and O
service O
was O
at O
its O
WORST O
! O
! O
! O

We O
summoned O
century O
egg O
' O
zhok O
' O
and O
almost O
wept O
, O
coz O
it O
was O
watery O
like O
Teochew O
porridge O
( O
what's O
happening O
? O
! O
) O
. O

The O
famous O
carrot B
cake I
with I
XO I
sauce I
. O

never O
say O
. O

First O
impression O
was O
that O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
with O
tables O
just O
2 O
small O
stools O
away O
from O
each O
other O
. O

Always O
have O
long O
queue O
especially O
weekends O
. O

From O
what O
I O
got O
she O
just O
doesn't O
want O
to O
be O
troubled O
to O
recalculate O
it O
again O
. O

If O
you O
like O
traditional O
dim O
sum O
style O
, O
this O
is O
a O
must O
try O
! O

Other O
than O
this O
dish O
, O
nothing O
is O
worth O
the O
queue O
. O

Jasmine O
tea O
was O
a O
refreshing O
beverage O
to O
wash O
down O
this O
savoury O
dish O
. O

If O
you O
want O
something O
sweet O
, O
try O
this O
egg B
tart I
! O
