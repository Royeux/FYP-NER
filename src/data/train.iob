and O
it O
didnt O
taste O
like O
them O
either O
. O

another O
must O
try O
is O
the O
fu B
pi I
juan I
( O
i O
can't O
remember O
the O
english O
name O
the O
shop O
gave O
it O
) O
. O

However O
, O
the O
service O
is O
pretty O
bad O
. O

The O
cheong B
fun I
was O
dry O
and O
the O
char O
siew O
inside O
was O
rather O
tasteless O
- O
- O
the O
sauce O
was O
salty O
and O
lacks O
a O
punch O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
comes O
when O
we O
inform O
the O
lady O
boss O
that O
we O
did O
not O
order O
the O
mango B
pomelo I
dessert O
, O
she O
argued O
loudly O
with O
us O
and O
together O
with O
2 O
of O
her O
staff O
. O

there O
is O
simply O
too O
many O
people O
wating O
to O
dine O
here O

Foodwise O
: O
I O
tend O
to O
enjoy O
subtle O

so O
I O
have O
read O
a O
couple O
of O

that O
have O
asked O
for O
stronger O

and O
those O
HGWers O
may O
not O
completely O
agree O
with O
me O
. O

Came O

we O
ordered O
almost O
everything O

If O
you O
are O
still O
visiting O
Viktor's O

, O
ask O
yourself O
this O
: O
Is O
the O
food O
really O
worth O
the O

you O

? O

But O

My O

it O
is O

they O
have O
a O

which O
is O
a O

not O
very O
clear O
to O

Like O
they O
expected O
us O
to O
somehow O
know O
where O
table O

Perhaps O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
went O
knowing O
what O
to O
order O
, O
but O
my O

I'll O

slightly O

I O
wun O
say O
the O
food O
is O
bad O

Will O
never O
understand O
why O
a O
small O

like O
this O
should O
be O
serving O
everyone O
like O
a O
butler O
in O
a O
grand O
mansion O
... O

And O
the O
wasabi B
shrimp I
is O
the O
must O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
skin O
was O
slightly O
soggy O
and O
broke O
too O
easily O
, O
and O
hence O
I O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
in O
fact O
inferior O
to O
the O
har B
gow I
from O
Imperial O
Treasure O
and O
Crystal O

. O

It O
was O
interesting O
, O
crispy O

not O
cloying O

isn't O
very O
prominent O

Got O
in O

and O
was O
given O
ordering O
sheet O
while O
waiting O
. O

It O
feels O
like O
teleported O
back O
to O
ancient O
china O
. O

I O
will O
just O
highlight O
the O
items O
worth O
trying O
: O
- O
- O
King B
Prawn I
Dumpling I
aka O
Har B
Kau I
simply O
because O
each O
har B
kau I
has O
2 O
medium O
size O
prawns O
. O

But O
it O
costs O
18 O
dollars O
for O
the O
small O
plate O
of O
roasted B
pig I
skin I
. O

It O
was O
moist O
, O
soft O
, O
yet O
refreshing O
as O
compared O
to O
its O
traditional O
fried O
counterpart O
. O

t O
have O
been O
able O
to O
find O
this O
place O
by O
myself O
. O

Definitely O
a O
place O
worth O
trying O
, O
service O
was O
very O
average O
but O
i O
suppose O
to O
be O
expected O
for O
a O
venue O
with O
high O
turnover O
of O
customers O
and O
quick O
service O
- O
everything O
was O
quite O
chop O

It O
was O
only O
after O

that O
I O
realized O
the O
flesh O
had O
been O
minced O
together O
with O
the O

The O
former O
had O
a O
crispy O

reminiscent O
of O

in O
certain O
aspects O

its O

when O
asking O

The O

a O

we O
found O

Even O
the O

some O

I O
noticed O
when O
the O

volume O
is O
low O
, O
the O
restaurant O
actually O
had O
ALOT O
of O
empty O
tables O
which O
they O
purposely O
left O
vacant O
so O
as O
to O
have O
a O

the O

to O
say O
the O

. O

we O
didn't O
order O
a O

up O

in O

not O

We O
figured O
we O
could O

should O
go O
to O
other O

which O
we O
would O
be O
happily O

most O

, O
knowing O
that O
we O

I O
had O

So O
if O
you O
ever O
patronize O
the O

, O
keep O
your O
eyes O
wide O
open O
or O
simply O
jot O
down O
the O

so O
you O

it O
will O
just O
be O

Fun I
but O
I'm O
just O
okay O
with O
it O
because O
I O
find O
that O
it O
doesnt O
quite O
mix O
well O
together O
. O

Awesome O
place O
for O
both O
young O
and O
old O
people O
. O

Just O
another O
one O
of O
those O
better O
places O
to O
have O
your O
dimsums O
at O
decent O
pricing O
. O

Waiting O
time O
for O
food O
was O
quite O
fast O
. O

Not O
impressed O
by O
it O
, O
but O
at O
least O
it's O
not O
horrid O
. O

My O
fav O
Swee O

What O
was O
missing O
however O
, O
was O
the O

Red O

is O
definitely O
a O
must O
bring O
to O
let O
your O
old O
folks O
enjoy O
the O
morning O
tea O
in O
the O
bustle O
of O
the O

and O
newspaper O

etc O
. O

The O
size O
of O
the O
pork O
is O
just O
nice O
. O

It O
is O
already O
very O
bustling O
and O
there's O
about O
20 O
person O
in O
front O
of O
me O
. O

Then O
turn O
right O
, O
continue O
on O
your O
way O
and O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O

5-8 O

Hence O
, O
when O
craving O
for O

in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O

, O
you O
know O
where O

The O

on O
its O
own O
and O
the O
filling O
too O
but O
it O
didnt O
work O
well O
together O
for O
me O
. O

Nowadays O
most O
dim O
sum O
restaurants O
does O
not O
do O
that O
anymore O
, O
it O
is O
usually O
ticking O
off O
the O
form O
of O
what O
dim-sum O
you O
want O
, O
and O
the O
waitress O
will O
bring O
it O
to O
you O
. O

They O
offer O
a O
decent O
enough O
fare O
but O
nothing O
to O
scream O
about O
, O
and O
I O
had O
tasted O
dim O
sum O
that O
is O
done O
better O
. O

Pry O
into O
it O
and O
wisps O
of O
steam O
will O
billow O
a O
positive O
sign O

first O
up O
was O
the O
chef's O
special O
appetizer O
of O
the O
day O
( O
see O
picture O
above O
) O
which O
happened O
to O
be O
wasabi B

and O

Words O
like O
overrated O
, O
not O
worth O
a O
visit O
roll O
off O
the O
tongues O
of O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
s O
naysayers O
. O

As O
a O
student O
, O
this O
is O
a O
Godsend O
when O
I O
dont O
feel O
that O
well O
and O
dont O
want O
to O
cook O
. O

When O
we O
told O
the O
cashier O
that O
we O
want O
to O
cancel O
our O
drink O
and O
foot O
the O
bill O
. O

Really O
not O
worth O
the O
frustration O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
the O
entrance O
, O
there O
was O
a O
long O
queue O
starting O
from O
inside O
the O
restaurant O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
staircases O
of O
the O
HDB O
. O

However O
the O
majestic O
name O
did O
itself O
no O
favors O
with O
a O
run O
of O
the O
mill O
watery O
porridge O
. O

It O
s O
worth O
a O
visit O
so O
just O
for O
several O
good O
items O
like O
the O
radish B
cake I
, O
porridge B
, O
glutinous B
rice I
and O
the O
custard B
buns I
. O

Overall O
an O
enjoyable O
experience O
. O

Personally O
.. O
i O
feel O
fresh O
shrimps O
are O
a O
must O
for O
dimsum O
... O

Don O
t O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
the O
food O
was O
good O
, O
but O
just O
not O
WOW O
. O

I O
was O
intrigued O
by O
its O
bouncy O
yet O
oh-so-tender O
consistency O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
would O
say O
its O
a O
good O
place O
to O
have O
dim O
sum O
! O

A O
definite O
must O
order O
here O
at O
Tim O

Better O
than O
the O
rest O
even O
in O
the O
not O
white O
society O
! O

The O
prawn O
dish O
was O
too O
spicy O
to O
eat O
. O

Didn't O
really O
like O
it O
because O
I O
don't O
like O
liver O
to O
begin O
with O
, O
and O
it O
tasted O
rather O
smelly O
and O
too O
strong O
. O

the O

the O

most O
of O
the O
items O
were O
crossed O
out O
leaving O
only O
the O
most O
expensive O
milk B

available O
. O

But O
the O
fried B
prawn I
dumpling I
is O
good O
. O

Victor's O

is O
the O
ONLY O
place O
which O
serves O

to O
the O

I O
don't O
even O

Most O
of O

don't O
taste O

taste O
more O
like O

from O

! O

For O
more O

and O
the O
full O

please O

And O
it O
was O
quite O
tastey O
, O
not O
extremely O
bonely O
either O
like O
some O
can't O
even O
find O
the O

Everything O
has O
to O
be O
requested O
, O
from O
asking O
for O
menu O

cleaning O

( O
Some O
of O
which O
you O
still O
have O
to O
ask O
for O
it O
more O
than O
once O
, O
as O
the O
staff O
just O
kept O
forgetting O
our O
request O
) O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
rather O
packed O
on O
the O
weekends O
so O
if O
you're O
planning O
to O
patronize O
on O
the O
weekends O
, O
i O
would O
recommend O
you O
to O
call O
in O
advance O
to O
avoid O
disappointment O
. O

The O
roll O
should O
be O
paper O
thin O
. O

It O
was O
fully O
packed O
. O

Very O
meaty O
with O
some O
prawns O
inside O
. O

Then O
we O
had O
the O
Har B
Gow I
( O
shrimp B
dumplings I
) O
- O
delicious O
, O
fresh O
and O
juicy O
shrimps O
wrapped O
in O
paperthin O
skins O
and O
steamed O
to O
perfection O
. O

Yet O
, O
it O
was O
delicious O
- O
the O
shrimp O
was O
big O
and O
juicy O
and O
the O
skin O
was O
not O
too O
thick O
, O
but O
still O
does O
not O
justify O
the O
price O
. O

Service O
sucks O
. O

The O
service O
attitude O
and O
behaviour O
are O
NOT O
acceptable O
. O

But O
we O
had O
to O
order O
it O
as O
we O
were O
starving O
and O
needed O
carbohydrate O
. O

The O
century B
egg I
porridge I
is O
sweet O
and O
very O
clear O
, O
not O
salty O
at O
all O
and O
tastes O
extremely O
healthy O
. O

Some O
of O
us O
prefer O
the O
fried O
style O
where O
the O
carrot O
cake O
is O
more O
crisp O
and O
firm O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
we O
had O
to O
queue O
to O
pay O
. O

That O
was O
painless O
enough O
- O
there O
were O

for O
people O
in O
line O
and O
servers O
were O
efficient O
in O
maximizing O
seating O
by O
seating O
the O
appropriate O
number O
per O
table O
. O

Moving O
away O
from O
the O
high O
end O
, O
modern O
dim O
sum O
places O
, O
red O
star O
restaurant O
is O
one O
that O
serves O
really O
traditional O
dim O
sum O
. O

Was O
recommended O
by O
a O
friend O
who O
told O
me O
they O
have O
pretty O
good O
custard B
buns I
which O
oozes O
out O
when O
you O
take O
a O
first O
bite O
but O
was O
left O
disappointed O
at O
the O
end O
. O

I O
personally O
feels O
that O
Tung O
Lok O
and O
Imperial O
makes O
better O
Dim O
Sum O
. O

never O
really O
tried O
a O
combination O
of O
fish O
( O
cod O
in O
this O
case O
) O
and O
tofu O
with O
black O
bean O
sauce O
but O
i O
must O
say O
, O
this O
was O
an O
inspired O
pairing O
. O

Also O
tried O
the O
century B
egg I
porridge I
& O
e-fu B
noodles I
. O

the O
place O
is O
very O
cramp O
. O

Why O
not O
four O
? O

The O
Crispy B
Fried I
Shrimp I
Dumpling I
( O
$ O
5 O
) O
was O
served O
in O
smaller O
sizes O
than O
normal O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
. O

When O
ordering O
of O
desserts O
, O
we O
were O
told O
that O
the O
lady O
who O
was O
in-charge O
of O
desserts O
is O
having O
her O
meal O
. O

I'm O
personally O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
fried O
stuffs O
, O
but O
my O
besties O
, O
despite O
or O
all O
their O
coughing O
and O
sore O
throats O
, O
they O
like O
this O
dish O
. O

Normally O
the O
one O
we O
eat O
at O
hawker O
centre O
contains O
lots O
of O
starch O
and O
over O
fried O
or O
become O
deep O
fried O
omelette O
with O
oysters O
( O
too O
oily O
! O
! O
) O
but O
this O
one O
is O
somewhat O
like O
home O
cooked O
omelette O
, O
not O
as O
oily O
as O
what O
you O
normally O
eat O
at O
hawker O
stall O
and O
definitely O
without O
the O
chewy O
starch O
in O
it O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
like O
about O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
is O
the O
unpretentious O
setting O
there O
. O

to O

I O
had O
experienced O
really O
terrible O
service O
at O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
today O
. O

The O
dim O
sums O
on O
the O
menu O
are O
quite O
interesting O
- O
eg O
. O

The O
second O
dim O
sum O
that O
thoroughly O
impressed O
me O
was O
the O
steam B
beancurd I
skin I
roll I
, O
which O
is O
actually O
pork O
and O
prawn O
fillings O
wrapped O
in O

. O

The O
place O
was O
your O
typical O
old O
school O

resturant O
. O

Another O
visit O
back O
to O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
and O
this O
time O
round O
we O
managed O
to O
eat O
the O
Yummy B

Custard I

! O
! O
! O

The O
fried B
hor I
fun I
is O
very O
good O
( O
enough O
wok O
hei O
to O
bring O
out O
the O
favour O
) O
. O

We O
really O
enjoyed O
the O
premium O
quality O
tea O
here O
! O

No O
need O
to O
see O
, O
the O
queue O
was O
forming O
till O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
shopping O
mall O
. O

Although O
when O
ordering O
, O
our O
server O
forgot O
a O
couple O
of O
items O
. O

The O
third O
was O
the O
best O
with O
fresh O
and O
crunchy O
prawns O
enveloped O
within O
a O
crispy O
deep O
fried O
exterior O
. O

And O
the O
1 O
on O
that O
item O
was O
obviously O
different O
from O
my O
strokes O
. O

Her O
service O
level O
was O
impeccable O
. O

They O
sliced O
the O
fish O
and O
stir O
fry O
with O
kailan O
. O

It O
might O
look O
bland O
, O
but O
meh O
, O
don O
t O
be O
deceived O
by O
the O
pale O
look O
of O
it O
. O

the O
drunken B
chicken I
was O
smooth O
and O
tasted O
pretty O
decent O
as O
well O
. O

Not O
to O
say O
that O
there O
were O
not O
much O
service O
, O
we O
had O
to O
take O
out O
pot O
of O
tea O
to O
go O
refill O
for O
hot O
water O
, O
we O
even O
had O
to O
pay O
a O
10 O
% O
service O
charge O
. O

the O
dark O
sauce O
made O
a O
good O
accompaniment O
to O
it O
. O

They O
serve O
dim O

all O

till O
7 O
or O

I O
found O

When O
I O

the O
q O

Only O
when O
I O

after O

some O

, O
only O
then O
she O
tried O
to O
chase O
the O

kept O
on O

me O
it O

Next O
, O
we O
would O

the O

of O
the O

was O

not O

The O

clean O
too O

Overall O
, O
I O
feel O
the O
food O
is O
really O
overrated O
as O
most O
of O
them O
do O
not O
taste O
as O
good O
as O
other O
claimed O

Honestly O
it O
tasted O
like O
prata O
with O
some O
onion O
. O

However O
, O
for O
those O
who O
think O
that O
the O
lava O
bun O
is O
too O
rich O
, O
the O
custard B
bun I
might O
actually O
be O
a O
better O
choice O
. O

the O
place O
is O
big O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
previously O
occupied O
tables O
have O
not O
been O
cleared O
which O
leaves O
a O
choice O
selection O
of O
tables O
near O
the O
kitchen O
entrance O
. O

Did O
not O
give O
points O
for O
ambience O
nor O
service O
but O
in O
previous O
experience O
when O
dining O
here O
, O
everything O
was O
perfect O
... O

You O
MUST O
order O
the O
Fried B
Golden I
Tofu I
( O
$ O
3.50 O
) O
that O
is O
lightly O
crusted O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
seasoned O
with O
pepper O
and O
salt O
. O

Like O
its O
surroundings O
, O
Cherry O
Garden O
s O
weekend O
dim O
sum O
buffet O
selection O
is O
mostly O
traditional O
, O
with O
a O
few O
modern O
touches O
like O
the O
escargot B
puff I
pastry I
( O
$ O
5.80 O
) O
. O

Generally O
the O
dim O
sum O
is O
mediocre O
and O
it O
is O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
the O
quality O
. O

So O
set O
aside O
at O
least O
30mins O
waiting O
time O
. O

Prompted O
the O
waitress O
to O
help O
us O
check O
our O
order O
in O
the O
kitchen O
but O
instead O
got O
a O
very O
rude O
response O
, O
how O
I O
know O
what O
you O
ordered O
? O

? O

Swee O

over O
40 O
years O
of O
history O
in O
Singapore O
, O
starting O
from O
1 O
single O

unit O
to O
absorbing O
it's O
surrounding O
neighbours O
. O

Prices O
are O
consider O
steep O
as O
this O
is O
not O
a O
restaurant O
but O
a O
small O
eatery O
. O

The O
carrot B
cake I
was O
soft O
and O
the O
sauce O
that O
accompanied O
it O
was O
not O
overly O
salty O
. O

Siew B

and O
har B

were O
both O
decent O
- O
all O
must-haves O
when O
my O
family O
eats O
dim O

. O

) O
but O
Chef O
Cheng O
executed O
them O
with O
so O
much O
flair O
, O
that O
even O
those O
adverse O
to O

will O
surely O
reach O
for O

( O
We O
heard O
that O
the O

actually O
from O

Not O
expecting O

from O
a O

It's O
cheap O
and O
this O
bowl O
certainly O
reflects O
it O
. O

Love O
the O
coffeeshop O
vibes O
though O
The O
standard O
and O
quality O
of O
the O
food O
dropped O
drastically O
recently O
. O

There O
was O
the O
usual O
suspects O
like O
Har B
Gao I
, O
Siew B
Mai I
, O
Char B
Siew I
Bao I
etc O
with O
nothing O
too O
special O
. O

I O
went O
with O
a O
friend O
, O
and O
saw O
others O
in O
large O
groups O
of O
friends O
/ O
family O
. O

My O
In-laws O
, O
hubby O
and O
myself O
enjoyed O
ourselves O
immensely O
. O

I O
mean O
if O
you O
are O
bringing O
clients O
who O
knows O
nothing O
about O
Chinese O
food O
then O
it O
would O
be O
' O
awesome O
' O
, O
' O
best O
dish O
i O
ever O
had O
' O
and O
similar O
comments O
but O
as O
far O
as O
locals O
are O
concern O
this O
restaurant O
is O
to O
be O
avoided O
. O

The O
tangy O
plum O
sauce O
and O
refreshing O
pomelo O
did O
a O
great O
job O
of O
whetting O
appetites O
. O

Cooking O
was O
generally O
excellent O
, O
but O
service O
was O
below O
par O
with O
room O
for O
improvement O
. O

Was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
chicken B
claw I
. O

I O
think O
we O
r O
paying O
more O
for O
the O
ambience O
. O

The O
eatery O
s O
rendition O
of O
the O
dessert O
had O
definitely O
reminded O
me O
of O
the O
one O
while O
I O
had O
at O
Yee O
Shun O
Milk O
Company O
in O
Hong O
Kong O

spent O
total O
of O

reasonable O

( O

I O
always O
like O
glutinous B
rice I
, O
dim O

style O
. O

The O
skin O
is O
very O
crisy O
, O
the O
prawns O
were O
very O
crunchy O
and O
plump O
but O
somehow O
the O
taste O
is O
not O
quite O
right O
and O
apple O
pcs O
were O
medicore O
. O

Even O
those O
that O
have O
tried O
the O
Hong O
Kong's O
branch O
gave O
the O
thumbs O
up O
too O
. O

Chef O
Victor O
( O
and O
yes O
a O
bonafide O
chef O
) O
has O
really O
expanded O
his O
menu O
and O
the O
space O
in O
the O
years O
since O
. O

Nothing O
too O
special O
about O
this O
but O
the O
skin O
was O
thin O
and O
the O
shrimp O
was O
fresh O
. O

I O
went O
with O
2 O
friends O
and O
we O
ordered O
the O
pumpkin B
custard I
and O
. O

In O
the O
end O
we O
over-ordered O
. O

Try O
to O
call O
a O
day O
in O
advance O
so O
you O
can O
collect O
it O
the O
next O
day O
. O

Some O
people O
like O

but O
if O

been O

this O

Heard O
good O
reviews O
from O
my O

to O
give O
it O

at O

Easily O
the O
highlight O
of O
our O
meal O
, O
all O
of O
us O
enjoyed O
this O
dish O

Bursting O
with O
flavour O
, O
each O
mouthful O
was O
a O
symphony O
of O
sweet O
- O
salty O
notes O
and O
I O
must O
admit O
that O
the O
gastronomical O
pleasure O
was O
rather O
soul O
satisfying O
. O

Personally O
, O
one O
word O
descibes O
the O
food O
: O
Fantastic O
! O

We O
love O
the O
cute O
splashing O

is O

Hello O

But O
the O

inside O
made O
it O
all O
up O
. O

Portion O
ok O
. O

Therefore O
we O
walked O
, O
ordered O
some O
dim O
sums O
, O
ready O
to O
eat O
once O
arrived O
. O

Seats O
are O
available O
indoors O
with O
air-conditioning O
and O
alfresco O
in O
the O
back O
alley O
for O
a O
nostalgic O
experience O
during O
your O
dim O

fare O
. O

So O
my O
friend O
packed O
it O
away O
, O
and O
her O
feedback O
was O
soft O
and O
nice O
to O
eat O
. O

The O
fried B
rice I
is O
even O
exceptionally O
good O
... O

This O
used O
to O
be O
my O
favourite O
dim O
sum O
place O
. O

Melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
but O
not O
in O
your O
hands O

Luxury O
, O
it O
was O
, O
wealth O
, O
it O
symbolized O
, O
and O
prestige O
, O
it O
presented O
. O

The O
Baked B
Bun I
with I
BBQ I
Pork I
received O
the O
most O
votes O
across O
the O
table O
. O

xo O
? O
? O
? O
( O
scallop B
, I
sausage I

$ O
4 O
) O
there O
were O
pieces O
of O
dried O
shrimp O
but O
we O
couldn O
t O
find O
any O
scallop O
. O

This O
was O
the O
umpteenth O
time O
we O
had O
a O
make-over O
of O
the O
har B
gau I
, O
they O
called O
it O
, O
Steamed B
Chinese I
spinach I
dumplings I
. O

I O
love O
how O
juicy O
and O
bouncy O
the O
prawns O
were O
and O
how O
crispy O
the O
beancurd O
sheet O
was O
. O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
happened O
today O
. O

The O
hongkong B
noodles I
however O
were O
a O
let O
down O
. O

Was O
disappointed O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
table O
to O
find O
out O
that O
they O
were O
using O
plastic O
cutlery O
for O
a O
rather O
high O
class O
dim O
sum O
restaurant O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
usual O
dim O
sum O
with O
the O
special O
and O
appetiser O
being O
Wasabi B
prawns I
and O
roast B
duck I
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
the O
amount O
of O
XO O
sauce O
given O
was O
rather O
generous O
, O
and O
i O
guess O
its O
more O
of O
a O
personal O
issue O
, O
some O
might O
just O
fancy O
this O
over O
the O
normal O
fried O
carrot B
cake I
. O

The O
staff O
is O
quite O
prompt O
and O
friendly O
though O
mostly O
only O
Chinese-speaking O
and O
the O
Dim O
Sum O
are O
served O
the O
traditional O
way O
: O
no O
menu O
, O
the O
waiters O
are O
pushing O
carts O
and O
drop O
by O
out O
table O
for O
us O
to O
order O
directly O
, O
create O
a O
very O
particular O
ambience O
. O

there O
was O
some O
eggroll O
thingie O
with O
pork O
floss O
which O
was O
also O
not O
bad O
. O

But O
well O
, O
this O
further O
proves O
to O
us O
that O
this O
is O
the O
first O
and O
last O
time O
we O
are O
patronising O
this O
shop O
. O

Very O
Chinoiserie-chic O
and O
classy O
. O

It O
opens O
at O
6pm O
and O
everybody O
just O
rushed O
in O
and O
sat O
down O
. O

I O
needed O
no O
further O
encouragement O
, O
i O
stood O
up O
and O
left O
the O
shop O
immediately O
as O
i O
was O
also O
in O
a O
rush O
. O

True O
, O
the O
char B
siew I
buns I
( O
limited O
to O
a O
plate O
of O
3 O
buns O
per O
customer O
) O
were O
tasty O
, O
but O
I O
would O
go O
to O
Summer O
Palace O
at O
Regent O
Hotel O
anytime O
for O
the O
buns O
. O

I O
DO O
NOT O
recommend O
this O
place O
, O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
look O
at O
the O
push O
carts O
and O
all O
the O
frustrations O
they O
bring O
about O
as O
well O
as O
the O
rudeness O
of O
the O
staffs O
. O

I O
could O
really O
taste O
the O
slices O
of O
radish O
inside O
. O

Food O
so O
so O
only O
, O
nothing O
special O
at O
all O

Red O
Star O
Restaurant O
offers O
a O
splendid O
range O
of O
dim O
sum O
. O

The O
prawns O
, O
like O
those O
in O
the O
Har O
Gaus O
, O
were O
so O
fresh O
you O
could O
hear O
them O
crunch O
! O

Sure O
, O
you O
can O
cavil O
at O
its O
operations O
long O
waiting O
time O
; O
service O
standards O
which O
at O
times O
can O
be O
sublime O
for O
a O
casual O
eatery O
but O
one O
thing O
you O
cannot O
deny O
: O
most O
of O
its O
dim O
sum O
dishes O
are O
laudable O
. O

Asparagus O
- O
A O
little O
spicy O
, O
not O
really O
a O
fan O
of O
asparagus O
so O
i O
felt O
it O
was O
ok O
. O

So O
when O
we O
finally O
got O
to O
get O
in O
, O
we O
quickly O
filled O
up O
the O
order O
forms O
and O
my O
father O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
few O
people O
to O
send O
the O
form O
to O
the O
counter O
. O

Though O
not O
as O
good O
as O
the O
one O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
that O
would O
be O
an O
unfair O
comparison O
. O

The O
dim O
lights O
and O
quiet O
atmosphere O
made O
it O
a O
perfect O
place O
for O
both O
my O
wife O
and O
i O
to O
have O
some O
quality O
time O
together O
. O

The O
skin O
was O
thin O
and O
it O
did O
break O
a O
little O
. O

Definitely O
better O
than O
any O
from O
a O
kopi O
tiam O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
as O
customers O
grew O
, O
customer O
service O
went O
downhill O
. O

Another O
hit O
was O
the O
Char B

If O
you O
intend O
to O
visit O
, O
I O
would O
advise O
to O
pass O
on O
the O
usual O
dim O
sum O
like O
siew B
mai I
, O
chicken B
claw I
, O
and O
chee B
cheong I
fun I
because O
not O
only O
is O
it O
expensive O

it O
didn't O
taste O

The O

are O
definitely O
a O
bit O
small O
and O
close O
to O
other O
diners O
. O

Sea O
cucumbers O
didn't O
have O
fishy O
taste O
and O
they O
were O
cooked O
just O
nice O
and O
the O
sauce O
taste O
good O
. O

But O
because O
they O
have O
become O
so O
popular O
, O
there O
are O
2 O
seatings O
( O
11am O
- O
1pm O
and O

Now O
this O
was O
a O
not-so-simple O
bun O
that O
was O
bound O
to O
turn O
heads O
. O

location O
wise O
, O
this O
place O
is O
right O
next O
to O
mustafa O
, O
so O
driving O
and O
finding O
parking O
during O
peak O
hours O
can O
be O
a O
hassle O
, O
but O
at O
least O
it O
is O
located O
in O
a O
central O
location O
and O
relatively O
near O
farrer O
park O
mrt O
and O
the O
new O

If O
you O
would O
like O
to O
have O
dim O

during O
the O
wee O
hours O
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
few O
places O
in O

that O
offers O

Overall O

it O
was O
a O
wonderful O
experience O
- O
excellent O
food O
and O
romantic O
ambience O

Our O
first O

Crisp O
Wasabi B

Prawns I
with I
fresh I
Mango I
and I
Fish I
Roe I
, O
arrived O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
our O
high O
expectations O
, O
just O
a O
bite O
into O
the O
lightly O
crisp O
succulent O
prawns O
was O
met O
with O
an O
outbrust O
of O
sweetness O
with O
a O
slight O
mango O
tang O
of O
sourness O
and O
a O
hint O
of O
spiciness O
from O
the O
wasabi O
. O

When O
we O
told O
the O
hostess O
/ O
cashier O
that O
we O
were O
very O
unhappy O
and O
that O
we O
never O
got O
all O
our O
food O
. O

Luo B
Mai I
Gai I
- O
a O
savoury O
steamed O
glutinous O
rice O
dish O
that O
consisted O
of O
mushrooms O
, O
chicken O
and O
chinese O
sausages O
; O
literally O
translated O
to O
mean O
sticky O
rice O
chicken O
. O

Sauted B
grouper I
fillet I
with I

, O
no O
parts O
of O
the O

were O

from O

What O
do O
u O
expect O
? O

I O
was O
there O
with O
my O
wife O
on O
our O
anniversary O
for O
their O
weekend O
dim O
sum O
buffet O
. O

The O
only O
down O
side O
for O
this O
place O
is O
that O
there O
is O
ALWAYS O
a O
queue O
, O
or O
at O
least O
for O
all O
the O
times O
I've O
been O
there O
. O

If O
time O
or O
money O
forbids O
you O
to O
hop O
on O
the O
next O
plane O
to O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
this O
restaurant O
can O
allow O
you O
to O
feel O
like O
you're O
there O
with O
its O
traditional O
pushcarts O
and O
staff O
screaming O
in O
Cantonese O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
a O
nice O
place O
to O
bring O
my O
father O
, O
show O
him O
a O
more O
traditional O
side O
of O
Singapore O
and O
have O
some O
good O
food O
too O
. O

( O
siew B
mai I
$ O
1.60 O
) O
- O
the O
parcels O
of O
ground O
pork O
weren O
t O
exceptional O
since O
its O
texture O
lacked O
springiness O
. O

Deep B
fried I
pork I
ribs I
with I
salt I
and I
pepper I
. O

But O
, O
one O
thing O
I O
have O
to O
say O
, O
the O
background O
music O
of O
the O
restaurant O
that O
keep O
replaying O
don't O
seems O
to O
blend O
well O
with O
the O
celebratory O
mood O
of O
my O
Mum's O
birthday O
. O

Carrot B
cake I
was O
also O
good O
, O
above O
average O
, O
can O
see O
bits O
of O
chinese O
ham O
? O

Hb O
said O
this O
taste O
lie O
the O
steamed O
spareribs O
but O
without O
the O
fermented O
black O
beans O
. O

It O
is O
very O
soft O
yet O
chewy O
despite O
being O
deep O
fried O
! O

The O
phoenix B
legs I
was O
also O
bad O
. O

But O
I'd O
eat O
this O
with O
great O
caution O
, O
coz O
the O
yam O
is O
sandwiched O
between O
very O
evil-looking O
slices O
of O
suckling O
pig O
belly O
... O

In O
fact O
, O
it O
was O
a O
tad O
plainer O
than O
the O
carrot O
cakes O
that O
I'm O
used O
to O
because O
it O
didn't O
come O
with O
a O
generous O
stuffing O
of O
the O
chinese O
sausage O
and O
other O
' O
liao O
' O
that O
you O
expect O
. O

Really O
dissappointing O
food O
. O

The O
stewed B
yam I
and I
pork I
was O
very O
tasty O
, O
and O
the O
yam O
was O
of O
a O
melt O
in O
your O
mouth O
quality O
. O

It's O
a O
million O
times O
better O
than O
the O
other O
dim O

just O

The O

were O
also O
delicious O

Came O
up O

Some O
of O
the O
food O
, O
they O
added O
some O
orange O
peel O
skin O
to O
it O
such O
as O
the O
baked B

with I
bbq I

. O

I O
would O
eat O
three O
plates O
of O
this O
if O
you O
placed O
them O
in O

of O
me O

Wasn't O
a O

too O
oily O
and O
not O
enough O

the O

didn't O

A O
typical O
chinese O
restaurant O
setting O
with O
dim O
sum O
served O
in O
push O
carts O
. O

Their O
milk B
tea I
was O
not O
bad O
, O
considering O
they O
served O
it O
in O
a O
bowl O
of O
ice O
to O
prevent O
the O
milk O
tea O
from O
becoming O
diluted O
. O

Thanks O
god O
that O
one O
of O
my O
friend O
volunteered O
to O
go O
early O
. O

phoenix B
leg I
was O
mediocre O
also O
. O

Food O
was O
very O
good O
and O
variety O
was O
quite O
mind O
boggling O
. O

I O
quite O
like O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
plain O
tasting O
as O
it O
complement O
the O
other O
dishes O
. O

From O

Firstly O
, O
the O
real O
treasure O
of O
the O
shop O
: O
the O
pork B
bun I
. O

Can't O
recall O
much O
about O
this O
except O
that O
it O
wasn't O
too O
sweet O
and O
a O
little O
dry O
. O

I O
woke O
up O
to O
a O
tropical O
, O
hot O
sunday O
morning O
having O
a O
craving O
for O
DIM O
SUM O
! O

Offers O
the O
usual O
dim O
sum O
stuff O
and O
opens O

after O
party O
hours O

so O
the O
next O
time O
you O
are O
in O
the O
vicinity O
looking O
for O
supper O
after O
night O
out O
drinking O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

For O
the O
Steamed B
Spare I
Ribs I
with I
Black I

, O
I O
would O
prefer O
whole O
black O
beans O
be O
used O
to O
bring O
out O
more O
flavour O
instead O
of O
bits O
of O
it O
, O
but O
nevertheless O
, O
it O
was O
very O
tender O

tasty O

Pan-fried B

and I
Mushrooms I
; O
I O
felt O
that O
the O
Pan-fried O
Gyoza O
were O
rather O
ordinary-tasting O
, O
the O
spiciness O
of O
the O
Eggplant O
failed O
to O
make O
any O
effect O
on O
the O
tastebuds O
while O
I O
believe O
that O
the O
mushrooms O

Tofu O
must O
have O
been O
hidden O
within O
the O
generous O
servings O
of O
minced O

In O
one O
of O
Chef O

he O
correctly O
pointed O
out O
that O

prefers O

The B
Baked I
Bun I
with I
BBQ I
Pork I
is O
really O
really O
good O
. O

Simple O
dish O
but O
with O
much O
texture O
, O
due O
to O
the O
insertion O
of O
raw O
vegetables O
. O

And O
so O
we O
ordered O
but O
indicating O
the O
qty O
on O
the O
checklist O
and O
pass O
to O
the O
auntie O
. O

They O
work O
on O
a O

you O

a O

One O
thing O
about O
Red O
Star O
is O
that O
they O
never O
stinge O
on O
the O
ingredients O
despite O
the O
crowd O
. O

One O
thing O
worth O
mentioning O
is O
the O
fish B
cooked I
in I
2 I
ways I
. O

I O
queued O
up O
at O
THW O
but O
as O
I O
was O
in O
a O
hurry O
, O
could O
only O
buy O
their O
famous O
baked B
char I
siew I
buns I
. O

As O
much O
as O
I O
loved O
the O
creativity O
, O
there O
was O
a O
snag O
. O

Can O
t O
fault O
a O
gal O
for O
trying O
. O

the O
prawn B
cheong I
fun's I
skin O
was O
smooth O
silky O
and O
thin O
and O
the O
prawns O
were O
huge O
and O
crunchy O
. O

We O
queued O
up O
for O
an O
hour O
to O
get O
into O
the O
outlet O
at O
Plaza O
Singapura O
. O

- O
Summer B
Ice I

a O
good O
mix O
of O
evaporated O
milk O
, O
diced O
up O
fresh O

, O
pomelo O
. O

The O
fried B
Mee I
Suay I
was O
unqiue O
, O
but O
it O
lacked O
flavour O
overall O
. O

NOW O
... O

Tim O
Sum O
during O
daytime O
is O
so O
popular O
that O
I O
give O
up O
queueing O
unless O
I O
wake O
up O
real O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
... O

The O
only O
one O
thing O
that O
really O
stands O
out O
is O
their O
durian B
pancake I
which O
was O
mentioned O
to O
be O
a O
hot O
seller O
. O

Wierd O
combination O
though O
. O

Manager O
says O
that O
the O
queues O
in O
HK O
are O
longer O
than O
in O
Singapore O
so O
take O
heart O
that O
we're O
lucky O
to O
have O
shorter O
queues O
. O

Should O
try O
if O
you O
have O
not O
tried O
this O
dessert O
in O
HK O
. O

But O
when O
we O
pressed O
him O
further O
that O
we O
saw O
someone O
doing O
takeaways O
, O
he O
stumbled O
and O
said O
that O
actually O
, O
they O
did O
give O
out O
paper O
bags O
to O
people O
who O
wanted O
to O
take O
away O
food O
. O

There O
is O
another O
version O
available O
, O
the O
Beijing-roasted B
duck I
. O

Not O
for O
those O
who O
need O
one O
big O
plate O
of O
fried O
rice O
for O
lunch O
or O
dinner O
. O

So O
it O
is O
good O
to O
check O
for O
the O
price O
when O
you O
order O
to O
avoid O
any O
misunderstanding O
. O

Hmm O
dunno O
wad O
to O
order O
so O
just O
use O
hungrygowhere O
as O
a O
guide O
and O
to O
my O
dismay O
, O
all O
the O
food O
recommended O
disappointed O
me O
; O
either O
i O
am O
of O
different O
frequency O
with O
other O
foodies O
here O
or O
the O
food O
standard O
drop O
until O
so O
jialat O
. O

You O
need O
to O
be O
early O
to O
secure O
seats O
if O
you O
have O
a O
large O
group O
. O

Its O
chewy O
, O
and O
slight O
refreshing O
. O

The O
trio O
tim O
sum O
and O
the O
pork O
dish O
are O
delicious O
. O

For O
the O
second O
day O
of O
its O
opening O
, O
we O
arrived O
at O
9:05 O
am O
and O
were O
the O
first O
in O
queue O
! O

:) O

A O
little O
bite O
sets O
the O
fluffy O

to O
explode O

but O
we O
were O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
layer O
of O
oil O
that O
we O
had O
to O
get O
through O
in O
order O
to O
taste O

ahhh O

just O

The O
last O
visit O
was O
a O
weekend O
last O
year O
and O
it O
was O
a O
long O
wait O
at O
the O
door O

And O
it O
was O
to O
my O
disappointment O
this O
time O
. O

Very O
traditional O
embience O
and O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
past O
. O

oh O
gosh O
, O
even O
if O
you O
aren't O
a O
fan O
of O

you O
will O
love O
this O

so O
much O
:') O
it O
kinda O
has O
the O
bo O
lo O

kind O

but O
EVEN O
BETTER O
than O
that O

push O

Cherry O
Garden O

definitely O
not O

What O
then O
ensues O
is O
the O
outflow O
of O
luxurious O
pork O

. O

The O
ones O
that O
missed O
the O
mark O
and O
failed O
were O

the O

at O
least O
6 O
times O
I O
was O
asked O
if O
can O
clear O
or O
want O
to O
order O
more O
. O

We O
just O
feel O
it O
is O
not O
morally O
right O
to O
charge O
high O
prices O
but O
not O
pay O
more O
to O
hire O
locals O
to O
work O
or O
pay O
levy O
for O
foreign O
workers O
. O

The O
inclusion O
of O
preserved O
vegetables O
was O
a O
brilliant O
stroke O
of O
art O
; O
the O
saltiness O
enhanced O
the O
flavour O
of O
the O
pork O
, O
which O
brought O
us O
to O
the O
question O
: O
why O
didn O
t O
anybody O
thought O
of O
this O
before O
? O

My O
Dad O
and O
I O
were O
rather O
impressed O
when O
our O
waiter O
could O
remember O
every O
single O
dish O
of O
our O
first O
order O
( O
around O
9 O
dishes O
? O
) O
. O

The O
Pork B
Dumplings I
with I
Shrimp I
( O
$ O
5.00 O
for O
4 O
pieces O
) O
also O
known O
as O
our O
shumai B
is O
tightly O
packed O
and O
firm O
, O
but O
could O
go O
on O
the O
edge O
of O
being O
slightly O
too O
tough O
for O
some O
. O

i O
idont O
regret O
we O
went O
here O
to O
try O
. O

If O
one O
isn't O
proactive O
enough O
to O
find O
the O
dim O

yourself O
( O

walk O
everywhere O
in O
the O
restaurant O
to O
find O
the O
food O
yourself O
instead O
of O
sitting O
at O
the O
table O
waiting O
) O
, O
one O
can O
spend O
a O
good O
2 O
hours O
there O
with O
only O
2 O
plates O
of O
dim O
sum O
on O
the O
table O
. O

The O
egg O
cake O
was O
porous O
, O
like O
a O
sponge O
that O
you O
can O
press O
it O
and O
it O
will O
bounce O
back O
. O

The O
thing O
about O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
is O
that O
their O
prawn O
dishes O
are O
fresh O
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
.. O
I O
tried O
to O
Yam B
Ring I
and O
HongKong B
Style I
fried I
noodles I
. O

Simple O
& O
good O
as O
I O
always O
say O
about O
this O
place O
. O

Oil O
was O
glistening O
under O
the O
lights O
but O
roasted B
duck I
meat O
are O
always O
oily O
right O
? O

It O
is O
so O
bland O
and O
has O
that O
cooked-in-the-pot-for-too-long O
taste O
, O
like O
one O
of O
those O
horrible O
porridges O
I O
had O
in O
Imperial O
Treasures O
and O
Jade O
Restaurant O
. O

Now O
more O
chinese O
waiters O
/ O

compared O
to O
Malaysian O

previously O
. O

Juicy O
chunks O
of O
radish O
are O
interspersed O
within O
the O
soft O
starchy O
steamed O
cake O
for O
a O
textural O
mouthfeel O
. O

Quite O
clever O
as O
the O
melted O
ice O
doesn't O
dilute O
the O
tea O
. O

I O
find O
this O
place O
very O
quaint O
and O
will O
be O
sad O
if O
it O
should O
close O
down O
, O
it's O
a O
dim O
sum O
place O
with O
a O
long O
history O
! O

The O
Staff O
are O
very O
unfriendly O
, O
at O
times O
are O
very O
rude O
too O
. O

I O
must O
say O
that O
I O
was O
disappointed O
with O
the O

there O
was O

It O

not O
nothing O

Should O
you O
find O
the O

a O

or O
that O
you O

we O
were O
there O
for O

and O
we O
went O
away O
with O
happy O
and O
full O

Almost O
every O

You O
can O
hardly O
find O
the O

in O
Singapore O
.. O

Having O
eaten O
at O
the O
original O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
in O
Mongkok O
, O
I O
was O
sorely O
disappointed O
by O
the O
Plaza O
Singapura O
branch O
. O

Quite O
a O
typical O
dish O
but O
it O
still O
impressed O
me O
and O
I O
definitely O
appreciated O
the O
ingredients O
for O
its O
freshness O
. O

Within O
the O
hour O
, O
we O
arrived O
at O
Swee O
Choon O
. O

Not O
too O
noisy O
, O
even O
with O
full O
lunch O
time O
crowd O
, O
so O
you O
can O
carry O
a O
decent O
conversation O
. O

The O
bun O
was O
fluffy O
and O
light O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
NOT O
WORTH O
GOING O
. O

That O
was O
about O
midnight O
. O

Viktor's O
Kitchen O
, O
here O
I O
come O
again O
. O

Egg B
tarts I
are O
on O
the O
same O
trolley O
as O
my O
char B
siew I
sou I
, O
so O
i'll O
always O
grab O
them O
along O
the O
way O
as O
well O
. O

We O
preferred O
it O
the O
way O
it O
was O
dressed O
in O
the O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
where O
the O
seasoning O
was O
of O
a O
rich O
savoury O

that O
had O
a O
beautiful O

we O
tried O
to O
get O

of O
a O

Mom O
, O

and O
I O
ordered O
a O

. O

Went O

( O

The O
following O
dishes O
make O
me O
a O
willing O
repeat O
customer O
. O

Swee O
Choon's O
minced O
pork O
is O
also O
less O
tasty O
than O
Din O
Tai O
Fung's O
. O

It's O
a O
pity O
it's O
so O
far O
( O
jalan O
besar O
) O
from O
where O
I O
stay O
( O
west O
) O
so O
travelling O
is O
a O
major O
X O
. O

The O
exterior O
of O
the O
bun O
was O
somewhat O
crumbly O
and O
fluffy O
, O
and O
the O
sweet-salty O
pork O
oozing O
out O
from O
the O
bun's O
centre O
was O
tender O
and O
simply O
lovely O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
workers O
stopped O
their O
work O
and O
gathered O
. O

The O
restaurant's O
ambience O
was O
really O
good O
, O
the O
' O
chinese O
mood O
' O
was O
there O
. O

It's O
after O
Hindoo O
Rd O
along O
Jalan O
Besar O
, O
only O
a O
few O
minutes O
away O
! O

But O
I O
feel O
that O
they O
over O
fried O
it O
so O
it O
was O
SUPER O
crispy O
. O

Went O
there O
with O
a O
few O
friends O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
, O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
since O
2 O
of O
us O
are O
there O
early O
to O
queue O
, O
started O
queuing O
around O
5pm O
, O
thinking O
it O
will O
be O
quite O
fast O
since O
it's O
a O
weekday O
and O
most O
ppl O
still O
haven't O
knock O
off O
but O
we O
are O
totally O
wrong O
, O
only O
manage O
to O
get O
a O
table O
for O
4 O
only O
around O
730pm O
. O

went O
there O
at O
about O
10 O
pm O
and O
the O
restaurant O
was O
still O
fully O
packed O
! O

It O
is O
because O
, O
personally O
I O
don't O
like O
sponge O
cake O
without O
any O
whipped O
cream O
. O

OMG O
, O
the O
worst O
dim O
sum O
in O
my O
life O
. O

Little O
touches O
like O
the O
complimentary O
individual O
servings O
of O
appetizer O
( O
some O
tasty O
pork O
/ O
bacon O
roll O
) O
and O
the O
pretty O
cutlery O
and O
utensils O
( O
was O
informed O
that O
they O
were O
the O
only O
hotel O
restaurant O
that O
uses O
the O
fine O
ware O
from O
Hankook O
St O
James O
series O
) O
were O
much O
welcomed O
. O

Four O
choices O
of O
desserts O
: O
black B
sesame I

in I
almond I
soup I
, O
red B

pancake I
, O
aloe B

& O
mango B

Must O
order O
is O
the O
Mee B
Suah I
Kueh I
, O
Liu B
Sha I
Bao I
and O
the O
pork B
floss I
pancake I
. O

Especially O
outstanding O
was O
the O
Wasabi B
Prawns I
which O
were O
huge O
and O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
while O
succulent O
on O
the O
inside O
with O
only O
a O
tinge O
of O
wasabi O
taste O
. O

I O
like O
the O
Siew B

too O
( O
1.80 O

2 O

Have O
visited O
this O

went O

wanted O

I O
absolutely O
love O

But O
i O
think O
it's O
worth O
it O
xDChar O
siew O

is O
my O
absolute O
favourite O
! O

We O
asked O
the O
lady O
who O
brought O
us O
in O
to O
help O
bring O
an O
additional O
chair O
. O

and O
when O
he O
came O
, O
he O
flashed O
an O
artificial O
smile O
and O
made O
an O
incredibly O
senseless O
comment O
did O
you O
dine O
at O
the O
restaurant O
? O

Cherry O
Garden O
is O
a O
great O
hideaway O
for O
an O
intimate O
Cantonese O
meal O
. O

Do O
not O
go O
on O
weekends O
and O
public O
holidays O
. O

My O
husband O
and O
I O
dined O
at O
Red O
Star O
on O
Tuesday O
morning O
( O
10:30 O
am O
) O
. O

Identical O
to O
that O
of O
Hong O
Kong O
s O
, O
the O
crumbly O
and O
fluffy O
, O
sweet O
exterior O
goes O
perfectly O
well O
with O
the O
salty O
, O
and O
substantial O
BBQ O
pork O
. O

Food O
is O
no O
special O
at O
all O
. O

Tired O
of O
waiting O
and O
hungry O
, O
the O
adults O
personally O
made O
their O
way O
to O
the O
kitchen O
to O
take O
the O
dim O
sum O
we O
wanted O
. O

The O
steamed B
beancurd I
roll I
in I
oyster I
sauce I
( O
$ O
3.20 O
) O
is O
also O
very O
good O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
thing O
that O
we O
can't O
tolerate O
is O
that O
we O
had O
to O
repeatedly O
remind O
them O
about O
our O
drinks O
... O

After O
having O
sat O
down O
, O
there O
is O
a O
feeling O
of O
being O
rushed O
to O
gobble O
down O
your O
food O
as O
many O
others O
are O
just O
waiting O
outside O
and O
watching O
you O
eat O
. O

Didn't O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
get O
a O
table O
for O
4pax O
, O
waiting O
time O
about O
15mins O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
glutinous B

, O

, O
siu B

, O
scallop O

were O

ordered O
it O
) O
, O
carrot B

( O
not O

not O

! O

It's O
one O
of O
the O
place O
that O
I O
would O
try O
to O
go O
often O
! O

Personally O
, O
I O
didn't O
really O
liked O
the O
claws O
prepared O
. O

Sounds O
unhygenic O
but O
I O
personally O
still O
find O
it O
ok O
. O

The O
other O
thing O
is O
, O
whenever O
there O
are O
elements O
of O
flower O
/ O
parts O
of O
flower O
in O
a O
dish O
, O
it O
always O
gives O
this O
cleansing O
effect O
, O
which O
is O
a O
feel-good O
mood O
. O

The O
overpowering O
pork O
taste O
and O
the O
yellow O
wanton O
skin O
left O
a O
Siew B
Mai I
feeling O
. O

Luckily O
for O
us O
, O
we O
got O
the O
last O
available O
table O
at O
the O
indoor O

air-conditioned O

the O

Gently O

slowly O
, O
I O
peeled O
open O
the O
soft O

fluffy O

the O

ooze O
out O
like O

you O

the O
pan-fried B

fun I
. O

Its O
warm O
and O
melts O
in O
your O
mouth O
the O
minute O
you O
bite O
into O
it O
. O

Another O
signature O
dish O
would O
be O
the O
Mee B
Sua I
Kueh I
( O
$ O
2 O
for O

) O
. O

And O
when O
we O
decided O
to O
try O
one O
portion O
, O
the O
friendly O
auntie O
said O
These O
run O
out O
very O
fast O
. O

This O
place O
is O
a O
, O
opened O
by O
1 O
of O
the O
4 O
heavenly O
kings O
of O
local O
cuisine O
, O
Mr O
Tham O
( O
I O
think O
? O
) O
. O

The O
Steamed B
XO I
Carrot I
Cake I
was O
clearly O
the O
star O
of O
the O
meal O
. O

We O
went O
to O
Red O
Star O
on O
a O
whim O
, O
for O
dinner O
, O
thinking O
that O
they O
would O
somehow O
still O
have O
dimsum O
, O
and O
expecting O
a O
restaurant O
similar O
to O
crystal O
jade O
. O

We O
had O
to O
order O
the O
desserts O
from O
one O
of O
the O
captain O
whom O
herself O
did O
not O
provide O
satisfactory O
service O
. O

At O
Victor's O
, O
you O
are O
given O
a O
slip O
of O
paper O
with O
the O
menu O
printed O
and O
you O
fill O
in O
the O
quantity O
of O
the O
items O
you O
want O
. O

The O
baked B
BBQ I
pork I
bun I
is O
very O
good O
, O
must O
try O
, O
we O
also O
had O
the O
siew B
mai I
( O
prawn B
dumpling I
) O
, O
liver B
chee I
cheong I
fun I
, O
bean B
curd I
skin I
, O
rice B
with I
chicken I
and I
sausage I
, O
pork B
congee I
, O
carrot B
cake I
. O

The O
taste O
of O
the O
egg O
custard O
stood O
out O
when O
I O
took O
my O
first O
bite O
. O

But O
it O
far O
exceeded O
my O
expectations O
. O

The O
prawns O
used O
, O
used O
to O
be O
crunchy O
and O
fresh O
, O
but O
the O
prawns O
that O
I O
recently O
ate O
, O
was O
mushy O
( O
a O
sign O
of O
the O
prawn O
not O
fresh O
) O
. O

Will O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
and O
again O
and O
again O
! O

The O
rest O
came O
in O
intervals O
of O
5-10 O
mins O
. O

The O
moist O
and O
tender O
meat O
that O
added O
to O
the O
smoothness O
of O
the O
overall O
flavor O
of O
the O
course O
. O

=( O
but O
oh O
well O
, O
since O
the O
damage O
is O
already O
done O
, O
let's O
just O
tuck O
in O
alright O
? O

the O

Interestingly O
, O
Red O
Star O
imposes O
a O
5 O
% O
service O
charge O
instead O
of O
the O
usual O
10 O
% O
. O

I O
don't O
see O
the O
logic O
, O
really O
. O

The O
skin O
was O
crisp O
and O
savoury O
, O
can't O
get O
enough O
of O
it O
. O

First O
time O
here O
. O

We O
asked O
a O
waitstaff O
and O
she O
gestured O
wait O
. O

Ate O
at O
the O
place O
last O
week O
. O

Its O
not O
cheap O
, O
nor O
does O
it O
have O
the O
ambience O
but O
we O
like O
the O
pushcart O
style O
and O
the O
dimsum O
. O

They O
would O
feel O
they O
are O
experiencing O
something O
a O
little O
more O
unique O
due O
to O
the O
food O
and O
ambience O
, O
but O
it's O
also O
suitable O
for O
the O
western O
palate O
. O

The O
custard O
combined O
with O
fragrant O
salted O
egg O
yolk O
was O
simply O
yummy O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
here O
is O
definitely O
not O
as O
refined O
as O
Crystal O
Jade's O
but O
is O
heavy O
on O
the O
flavour O
and O
very O
old O
school O
. O

Left O
disgusted O
after O
waiting O
an O
hour O
. O

Finally O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
tried O
out O
this O
after O
so O
long O
! O

The O
carrot B
cake I
is O
the O
best O
dish O
of O
the O
lot O
and O
glutinous B
rice I
not O
too O
bad O
either O
( O
for O
some O
biased O
reason O
) O
. O

I O
do O
agree O
with O
one O
of O
the O
reviewers O
and O
I O
too O
cannot O
taste O
the O
scallop O
and O
sausage O
( O
I O
am O
assuming O
lap O
cheong O
) O
. O

I O
don O
see O
it O
else O

I O
was O
more O
distracted O

brought O
about O
by O
the O

of O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
value O
for O
money O
and O
you O
feel O
you O
deserve O
better O
treatment O
as O
a O
paying O
customer O
, O
I O
recommend O
coming O
here O
ONCE O
, O
eat O
the O
d O
* O
* O
* O
baos O
( O
which O
is O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
honestly O
) O
so O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
come O
here O
to O
be O
humiliated O
and O
treated O
like O
trash O
by O
this O
establishment O
. O

Let's O
start O
with O
the O
food O
( O
what O
I O
had O
today O
): O
Siew B
Mai I
: O
Simply O
average O
, O
there O
are O
no O
more O
crunch O
that O
comes O
from O
chunks O
of O
fresh O
prawn O
Ha B
Gao I
( O
Prawn B
dumplings I
): O
Not O
as O
good O
but O
still O
decent O
, O
the O
skin O
is O
thin O
and O
the O
prawn O
is O
relatively O
fresh O
with O
the O
crunch O
Fried B
Cheong I
Fan I
: O
A O
relatively O
new O
item O
, O
tastes O
pretty O
ok O
but O
take O
note O
to O
eat O
it O
fast O
before O
it O
soaks O
up O
all O
the O
gravy O
Zha B
Leong I
( O
Fried O
dough O
fritters O
wrapped O
in O
Cheong O
Fan O
): O
Used O
to O
be O
one O
of O
my O
favourites O
, O
now O
the O
dough O
fritters O
thoroughly O
over O
fried O
, O
dry O
and O
hard O
, O
not O
recommended O
for O
weak O
teeth O
and O
jaws O
. O

It's O
then O
coated O
with O
a O
thin O
layer O
of O
flour O
and O
deep O
fried O
. O

And O
with O
every O
fine O
dining O
restaurant O
, O
the O
diners O
are O
kept O
well O
out O
of O
sight O
from O
passers-by O
, O
who O
might O
just O
pop O
their O
head O
in O
once O
in O
a O
while O
, O
thus O
giving O
diners O
the O
privacy O
of O
dining O
. O

Picture O
this O
: O
Old O
and O
dirty O
carpet O
, O
cheesy O
70s O
- O

upscale O
Chinese O
restaurant O
ceiling O

, O
dimly O

a O

bad O
wedding O
karaoke O
and O
dirty O
used O
plates O
conveniently O
stacked O
at O
multiple O
corners O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

the O
char B
siew I
buns I
and O
milky B
custard I
buns I
were O
normal O
. O

So O
it O
would O
be O
advisable O
to O
sit O
outside O
( O
about O
3 O
tables O
only O
) O
. O

Portuguese B

is O
so O
popular O
that O
it O

5 O
units O
of O
shophouses O
along O
this O
stretch O
of O
road O
. O

Crispy B
chao I
Siew I
bun I
- O
excellent O
tasty O
and O
crispy O
( O
Must O
eat O
) O
. O

This O
was O
such O
a O
well O
executed O
course O
that O
I O
had O
no O
regrets O
. O

Pork B
ribs I
: O
There O
were O
more O
bones O
than O
meat O
here O
and O
the O
dish O
was O
quite O
small O
, O
quite O
a O
disappointment O
. O

The O
previous O
time O
I O
visited O
was O
2 O
years O
ago O
, O
I O
recalled O
it O
being O
affordable O
. O

( O
- O
) O
XO O
sauce O
was O
barely O
evident O
in O
taste O
, O
tasted O
more O
like O
mere O
soy O
sauce O
. O

I O
am O
looking O
forward O
to O
my O
next O
visit O
to O
explore O
other O
dishes O
and O
hope O
it O
will O
be O
great O
too O
! O

We O
were O
TOLD O
to O
return O
the O
extra O
chair O
. O

I O
have O
no O
particular O
complaints O
about O
their O
service O
standards O
as O
to O
me O
, O
it O
is O
a O
mere O
eatery O
anyway O
. O

As O
a O
whole O
Swee O
choon O
offers O
quite O
delicious O
dim O
sum O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
here O
is O
not O
bad O
but O
I O
would O
not O
queue O
like O
the O
fanatics O
did O
when O
the O
restaurant O
first O
open O
few O
months O
ago O
. O

DIE O
DIE O
HAVE O
TO O
ORDER O
ONE O
. O

It O
has O
a O
history O
and O
there O
are O
few O
places O
in O
Singapore O
that O
serve O
dim O
sum O
this O
way O
. O

Ubnfortunately O
, O
the O
service O
needs O
to O
be O
improved O

in O

which O
they O
typically O
put O
on O
dim O
sum O
in O
other O
places O
. O

The O
only O
decent O
dish O
was O
their O
steamed B
carrot I
cake I
with I
XO I
sauce I
. O

It O
was O
super O
fluid O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
yam O
was O
minimal O
and O
it O
seemed O
like O
the O
dessert O
was O
diluted O
. O

As O
an O
appetiser O
they O
serve O
some O
pickled O
cabbage O
thing O
, O
which O
we O
enjoyed O
very O
much O
. O

I O
would O
very O
much O
go O
to O
restaurants O
where O
i O
order O
and O
i O
get O
what O
i O
want O
. O

nothing O
much O
to O
mention O
cos O
the O
previous O
member O
already O
almost O
mention O
the O
whole O
menu O
. O

Together O
with O
its O
famous O
Chee B
Cheong I
Fan I
. O

The O
ala-carte O
buffet O
lunch O
is O
a O
pretty O
good O
deal O
, O
seeing O
how O
you're O
paying O
for O
the O
hotel O
ambience O
. O

But O
their O
winning O
dish O
is O
their O
big O
prawn-fried B
mee I
, O
topped O
with O
silky O
egg O
. O

I O
prefer O
mine O
with O
a O
lighter O
, O
eggier O
filling O
. O

Friend O
thinks O
Dim O
Joy's O
is O
better O
. O

horrible O
honkie O
staffs O
there O
. O

A O
pathetic O
shade O
of O
its O
former O
self O
. O

i'm O
not O
too O
sure O
... O

You O
may O
want O
to O
try O
their O
chinese O
food O
like O
dumpling O
and O
la B
mien I
.. O

It's O
unique O
, O
sure O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
is O
really O
good O
and O
I O
think O
it's O
even O
better O
the O
famous O
one O
in O
geylang O
. O

Best O
time O
to O
come O
is O
probably O
sunday O
evenings O
. O
=) O

They O
will O
love O
it O
! O
! O

My O
parents O
would O
always O
bring O

they O
offer O
a O
huge O
variety O
of O

- O
enjoyed O
the O

a O

, O
and O
will O
definitely O
be O
back O
for O
more O
! O

I O
do O
have O
to O
admit O
though O
, O
I O
did O
not O
try O
this O
one O
because O
I O
usually O
steer O
clear O
of O
animal O
organs O
. O

The O
small O
chili O
helped O
in O
creating O
that O
extra O
refreshing O
spicy O
kick O
that O
intensifies O
the O
flavour O
as O
well O
. O

( O
har B
kow I
$ O
2.20 O
) O
- O
we O
didn O
t O
like O
the O
doughy O
skin O
, O
which O
was O
already O
torn O
upon O
serving O
though O
the O
prawns O
were O
succulent O
. O

and O
the O
what O
we O
got O
in O
respond O
was O
SORRY O
AH O
and O
that O
we O
sld O
change O
to O
another O
dish O
because O
nobody O
felt O
it O
was O
sour O
. O

We O
ate O
there O
on O
Sat O
morning O
and O
when O
we O
were O
there O
at O
10am O
, O
there O
was O
no O
queue O
! O
! O
! O

it O
was O
thick O
and O
a O
little O
chunky O
, O
but O
no O
fishy O
taste O
, O
despite O
the O
presence O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

The O
so O
called O
famous O
salted B
egg I
yolk I
bun I
.. O
it O
was O
so O
oily O
that O
the O
oil O
can O
fill O
a O
saucer O
. O

The O
century B
egg I
porridge I
was O
disappointing O
. O

Your O
staff O
was O
able O
tell O
us O
clearly O
what O
goes O
into O
the O
ingredient O
for O
each O
dish O
and O
suggested O
alternative O
. O

ok O
lah O
at O
least O
charsiew O
is O
nice O
but O
then O
u O
can O
buy O
cheaper O
replicas O
in O
breadtalk O
... O

It O
didn't O
seem O
special O
to O
me O
, O
and O
it O
had O
too O
much O
dried O
shrimp O
inside--of O
which O
I O
am O
not O
a O
fan O
. O

I O
been O
to O
Tim O
ho O
wan O
on O
at O
least O
3 O
occasion O
before O
i O
made O
this O
verdict O
. O

for O
more O
: O
I O
don O
t O
really O
understand O
all O
the O
praise O
and O
rave O
about O
this O
place O
. O

The O
xiao B
long I
bao I
and O
har B
gao I
on O
the O
other O
hand O
wasn't O
very O
impressive O
, O
dont O
bother O
.. O

Find O
the O
food O
wise O
are O
somehow O
over-rated O
. O

Never O
in O
my O
heart O
, O
I O
stopped O
thinking O
of O
you O
. O

You O
will O
find O
top-notch O
service O
here O
compared O
to O
other O
chinese O
restaurants O
. O

The O
chee B
cheong I
fun I
is O
also O
a O
must O
try O
, O
i O
love O
the O
chunky O
bits O
of O
char O
siew O
in O
them O
and O
of O
course O
the O
prawn O
version O
was O
delicious O
too O
! O

Sound O
pretty O
awesome O
right O
? O

The O
accompanying O
caramelized O
sauce O
that O
assayed O
akin O
to O
BBQ O
char O
siew O
sauce O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
, O
they O
missed O
a O
couple O
of O
my O
orders O
. O

but O
the O
queue O
is O
always O
so O
long O
! O
! O
:( O

If O
you O
get O
the O
soya B
bean I
drink I
, O
I'd O
recommend O
going O
for O
the O
hot O
one O
. O

It O
has O
been O
a O
while O
since O
I O
last O
visited O
. O

As O
far O
as O
we O
can O
remember O
, O
the O
price O
of O
their O
fares O
had O
been O
increased O
a O
few O
times O
over O
the O
years O
, O
and O
their O
current O
prices O
are O
on O
par O
with O
some O
good O
dimsum O
restaurants O
with O
far O
better O
service O
, O
food O
quality O
and O
dining O
environment O
. O

Those O
not O
so O
popular O
food O
will O
probably O
have O
the O
chance O
to O
travel O
on O
the O
cart O
to O
further O
corners O
of O
the O
restaurant O
. O

But O
to O
be O
honest O
its O
not O
what O
we O
have O
been O
expecting O
from O
a O
Michelin O
Star O
restaurant O
. O

Crisp O
, O
rough O
texture O
on O
the O
outside O
while O
the O
interior O
was O
moist O
. O

The O
inside O
of O
stall O
doesn't O
seem O
very O
sparkly O
clean O
but O
can't O
complain O
much O
, O
just O
decent O
enough O
to O
eat O
and O
go O
. O

Although O
it O
wasn O
t O
crowded O
, O
our O
presence O
somehow O
escaped O
the O
staff O
and O
after O
waiting O
for O
a O
while O
K O
decided O
to O
approach O
one O
for O
order O
chits O
. O

Too O
watery O
for O
my O
liking O
. O

I O
could O
use O
more O
chilli O
in O
the O
OX O
sauce O
. O

So O
there O
I O
was O
, O
standing O
in O
front O
of O
the O
Esplanade O
, O
in O
front O
of O
Mandarin O
Oriental O
and O
Meritus O
Mandarin O
, O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
which O
hotel O
it O
is O
located O
in O
. O

so O
anyway O
, O
we O
had O
problems O
fitting O
6 O
of O
us O
to O
a O
table O
due O
to O
the O
space O
constraints O
. O

Victor's O
has O
been O
hailed O
by O
many O
for O
its O
cheap O
and O
good O
dim O
sum O
. O

Each O
order O
must O
come O
with O
a O
saucer O
of O
their O
very O
delicious O
( O
& O
expensive O
) O
XO O
sauce O
which O
you O
must O
pour O
on O
the O
carrot B
cake I
before O
digging O
in O
! O

Since O
the O
opening O
of O
new O
ouelts O
, O
the O
queue O
at O
the O
original O
outlet O
is O
shorter O
, O
but O
there O
are O
still O
queues O
. O

Really O
good O
. O

dere's O
both O
Hongkong O
and O
Shanghai O
dimsum O
. O

But O
today O
, O
i O
had O
a O
good O
seat O
with O
good O
lighting O
, O
so O
ladyironchef O
proudly O
presents O
the O
Dim-sum O
from O
Red O
Star O
. O

hmm O
, O
the O
difference O
in O
food O
cultures O
eh O
? O

The O
accompanying O
pork O
floss O
did O
well O
to O
enhance O
the O
flavour O
of O
the O
soya O
bean O
dish O
. O

The O
Xiao B
Long I
Bao I
( O
or O
pork O
minced O
meat O
dumpling O
with O
hot O
soup O
broth O
) O
( O
$ O
4 O
for O
4 O
) O
is O
pretty O
decent O
. O

Would O
recommend O
baked B
bun I
with I
bbq I
pork I
, O
the O
salted B
egg I
and I
century I
egg I
porridge I
, O
teochew B
dumpling I
, O
steamed B
beancurd I
rolls I
with I
shrimp I
and I
pork I
and O
lastly O
shrimp B
dumpling I
. O

Service O
was O
so-so O
but O
was O
acceptable O
for O
me O
, O
since O
they O
only O
charged O
5 O
% O
service O
charge O
. O

and O
then O
she O
yelled O
and O
yelled O
repeating O
the O
words O
, O
one O
group O
of O
the O
adjacent O
table O
, O
I O
don't O
know O
, O
from O
the O
sound O
I O
can O
tell O
that O
they O
persuade O
her O
to O
let O
it O
go O
, O
forgive O
us O
, O
like O
that O
. O

But O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
food O
can O
be O
quite O
medicore O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

Huge O
crunchy O

The O

was O
incredibly O
crispy O
though O

At O
least O
for O
my O
standards O
and O
for O
the O
price O
I O
paid O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
worth O
the O

I O

So O
I O
trotted O
to O
Sunshine O

to O
check O
out O
what O
this O
buzz O
was O
all O
about O
. O

The O
pricing O
here O
is O
also O
not O
as O
cheap O
as O
what O
I O
expected O
for O
non O
- O
fine O
Chinese O

Ventured O
here O
on O
a O
sunday O
afternoon O
. O

Swee O
Choon O
is O
an O
awesome O
supper O
place O
and O
definitely O
worth O
a O
visit O
because O
the O
food O
is O
cheap O
and O
good O
. O

I O
don't O
know O
what O
I O
was O
eating O
. O

I O
could O
never O
finish O
one O
of O
these O
on O
my O
own O
. O

I O
enjoyed O
the O
food O
here O
at O
Cherry O
Garden O
, O
but O
I O
definitely O
over-ordered O
! O
! O

Having O
dined O
there O
twice O
before O
, O
I O
was O
more O
enamored O
by O
its O
intricately O
oriental O
design O
than O
the O
food O
( O
most O
unfortunately O
! O
) O
. O

My O
mother O
observed O
that O
the O
kitchen O
processes O
the O
orders O
rather O
randomly O
. O

Indeed O
one O
of O
our O
friend O
would O
consider O
this O
yummy O
. O

a O
great O
weekend O
treat O
with O
delights O
such O
as O
the O
succulent O
har B
gau I
and O
stewed O
char B
siew I
baos I
with O
soft O
fluffy O
skins O
. O

Although O
I O
am O
not O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
char O
siew O
buns O
normally O
, O
I O
love O
this O
one O
and O
I O
believe O
you O
would O
too O
! O

Wondering O
how O
it O
will O
taste O
like O
, O
we O
were O
actually O
quite O
apprehensive O
to O
try O
it O
. O

Food O
was O
served O
piping O
hot O
and O
fairly O
fast O
. O

( O
+ O
) O
Crunchy O
shrimps O
inside O
offered O
a O
very O
delectable O
bite O
to O
the O
crispy O
skin O
. O

For O
full O
review O
and O
pictures O
of O
everything O
we O
ate O
, O
please O
visit O

Ambience O
- O
Though O
the O
place O
is O
air-conditioned O
, O
it O
gets O
a O
little O
warm O
inside O
as O
the O
place O
is O
rather O
cramped O
. O

Another O
hidden O
find O
is O
e O
fried B
tofu I
with I
pork I
floss I
.. O

Last O
dish O
of O
my O
order O
was O
the O
Golden B
Egg I
Yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
( O
$ O
4 O
) O
, O
a O
must O
try O
item O
from O
Victor's O
. O

Steamed B
Egg I
Cake I
( O
$ O
3.80 O
for O
1pc O
): O
I O
didn O
t O
agree O
with O
my O
dining O
companions O
on O
this O
item O
, O
as O
they O
seemed O
to O
enjoy O
this O
thoroughly O
to O
the O
very O
last O
morsel O
, O
while O
I O
barely O
took O
more O
than O
two O
bites O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
drunken B
chicken I
was O
tastier O
than O
expected O
. O

It's O
my O
second O
visit O
today O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
ok O
for O
the O
prawn O
:) O

( O
- O
) O
The O
skin O
of O
the O
dumpling O
was O
soft O
and O
thin O
but O
too O
sticky O
, O
leaving O
remnants O
at O
the O
teeth O
. O

Indeed O
, O
the O
yellow O
custard O
started O
oozing O
out O
of O
the O
bun O
the O
moment O
it O
was O
peeled O
apart O
. O

Came O
across O
this O
place O
few O
years O
ago O
but O
only O
try O
it O
few O
weeks O
ago O
.. O

Even O
though O
the O
price O
is O
cheap O
, O
the O
food O
is O
not O
nice O
... O

The O
food O
, O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
is O
decent O
, O
but O
not O
really O
the O
main O
draw O
( O
in O
my O
opinion O
) O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
was O
just O
average O
not O
too O
bad O
but O
not O
good O
enuff O
to O
leave O
a O
lasting O
impression O
. O

The O

were O
soft O

Siew O
on O
the O
insides O

so O
crisp O
on O
e O
outside O
yet O
soft O
on O
e O
inside O
.. O

Not O
sure O
if O
there O
are O
other O
places O
but O
this O
is O
one O
place O
where O
one O
gets O
to O
have O
affordable O
simple O
dim O
sum O
for O
supper O
along O
the O
back O

of O
the O

For O
months O

people O
have O
been O
thronging O
to O
this O
place O
for O
some O
dim O
sum O
lovin O
even O
at O
the O
wee O
hours O

BTW O
they O
served O
pretty O
good O
congee B
and O
mango B
pudding I
( O
my O
soft O
spot O
) O
, O
do O
order O
those O
if O
you O
visit O
:) O

Despite O
of O
my O
friend's O
recommendation O
for O
Ma B
Lai I
Gao I
, O
it O
was O
under O
my O
expectation O
; O
I O
didn't O
like O
the O
texture O
and O
it O
tasted O
really O
porous O
lol O
. O

Egg O
tart O
lovers O
- O
be O
warned O
they're O
not O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

Almost O
like O
art O
, O
delicately O
crafted O
. O

served O
on O
a O
plate O
, O
the O
carrot B
cake I
didnt O
look O
like O
the O
typical O
blocks O
of O
carrot B
cake I
i O
used O
to O
have O

Whenever O
there's O
any O
family O
occasion O
, O
we O
like O
to O
go O
for O
the O
set O
dinner O
. O

The O
dedicated O
staffs O
were O
all O
smiles O
and O
made O
the O
dining O
experience O
so O
much O
more O
pleasant O
. O

recommended O
. O

Arrived O
at O
1pm O
on O
a O
Saturday O
. O

Now O
that O
I O
know O
why O
these O
drinks O
were O
served O
last O
or O
almost O
, O
with O
time O
on O
my O
side O
, O
I O
enjoyed O
watching O
her O
go O
through O
her O
routine O
. O

- O
Liu B
Sha I
Bao I
( O
Custard B
Bun I
): O
The O
skin O
is O
thin O
and O
after O
5 O
mins O
, O
the O
oil O
of O
the O
custard O
filling O
was O
starting O
to O
be O
seen O
through O
the O
skin O
. O

I O
waited O
for O
about O
20 O
minutes O
in O
line O
, O
and O
the O
staff O
were O
surprisingly O
not O
grumpy O
despite O
having O
to O
be O
on O
their O
feet O
running O
around O
all O
the O
time O
. O

On O
a O
more O
objective O
point O
of O
view O
, O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
food O
, O
I O
have O
to O
say O
it's O
value O
for O
money O
, O
it's O
definitely O
restaurant O
standard O
food O
at O
very O
affordable O
prices O
. O

And O
the O
dim O
sum O
kept O
on O
coming O
non-stop O
there O
was O
no O
space O
on O
the O
table O
we O
had O
to O
quickly O
eat O
those O
to O
let O
more O
in O
! O

As O
for O
the O
lor B
mai I
kai I
is O
slightly O
better O
than O
average O
as O
the O
chicken O
was O
very O
tasty O
and O
the O
glutinous O
rice O
was O
not O
too O
dry O
. O

To O
top O
it O
off O
, O
the O
Zha B
Leong I
( O
Doughstick O
wrap O
in O
rice O
roll O
) O
version O
was O
even O
better O
. O

I O
can't O
say O
that O
Red O
Star O
has O
the O
absolute O
best O
dim O
sum O
in O
Singapore O
, O
but O
theirs O
is O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I've O
had O
. O

When O
we O
ordered O
chinese O
wine O
we O
were O
told O
they O
were O
out O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
too O
! O

The O
carrot B
cake I
is O
also O
a O
plus O
, O
since O
i O
really O
tasted O
the O
thin O
silvers O
of O
radish O
present O
in O
the O
cake O
. O

But O
it O
didnt O
turn O
out O
well O
. O

I O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
expectations O
for O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
, O
because O
of O
all O
the O
buzz O
created O
about O
it O
. O

Unless O
like O
any O
typical O
HK O
citizen O
who O
has O
no O
qualm O
bout O
using O
strange O
names O
on O
themselves O
, O
she O
is O
really O
Victor O
! O

We O
loved O
the O
tranquil O
ambience O
as O
well O
as O
the O
warm O
, O
attentive O
service O
. O

The O
food O
is O
definitely O
not O
worth O
any O
wait O
. O

but O
dont O
come O
here O
if O
you're O
not O
willing O
to O
queue O
... O
! O

But O
then O
again O
, O
i O
loved O
the O
fluffiness O
of O
the O
bun O
, O
so O
i O
didn't O
mind O
that O
it O
compromised O
on O
the O
amount O
of O
filling O
. O

The O
custard B
bun I
was O
pretty O
good O
too O
. O

Reasonably O
priced O
and O
food O
is O
ok O
. O

We O
randomly O
placed O
orders O
for O
food O
which O
of O
course O
include O
the O
mundane O
Siew B
Mai I
and O
Har B
Kow I
. O

There O
is O
also O
a O
hint O
of O
Chinese O
wine O
in O
the O
meat O
. O

Tried O
their O
signature O
Egg B
york I
lava I
bun I
and O
I O
must O
say O
the O
volcano O
must O
have O
been O
dormant O
for O
a O
long O
time O
as O
the O
filling O
ain't O
even O
oozing O
out O
as O
expected O
. O

Then O
we O
waited O
for O
someone O
to O
give O
us O
the O
card O
so O
that O
we O
can O
order O
food O
. O

As O
with O
all O
good O
Tim O
sum O
dining O
places O
, O
the O
standard O
items O
like O
the O
har B
Kao I
and O
siew B
mai I
are O
all O
there O
. O

Overall O
, O
I'm O
glad O
I've O
tried O
the O
famous O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
, O
and O
I O
was O
not O
disappointed O
by O
my O
visit O
, O
but O
I O
do O
not O
see O
any O
need O
to O
go O
again O
, O
unless O
to O
eat O
those O
Teochew B
dumplings I
. O

=P O
Definitely O
a O
restaurant O
with O
much O
ambience O
and O
zen-like O
Chinese O
interiors O

So O
i O
bring O
my O

the O

One O
of O
their O

( O

came O
and O
grumbled O
that O
we O
took O
two O
chairs O
for O
the O

and O
now O
they O
had O
a O
shortage O
of O
chair O

However O
, O
the O
polo B

felt O
sweeter O
when O
I O
finally O
managed O
to O
find O
it O
. O

Thick O
and O
fragrant O
with O
no O
hint O
of O
tartness O
( O
which O
happens O
sometimes O
when O
tea O

recycled O

, O
I O
would O
return O
for O

tea O
alone O

Total O
bill O
came O
up O
to O
$ O
89 O
for O
the O
dum O

which O
i O
thought O
was O
reasonable O

No O
matter O

how O
busy O

be O

the O

must O

decide O
that O
I'm O
ready O
to O
review O
this O
place O
. O

Food O
came O
relatively O
quickly O
and O
i O
was O
pretty O
please O
with O
the O
food O
quality O
. O

Well O
derserved O
name O
! O

Amazing O
foodstuff O
, O
friendly O
service O
, O
short O
waiting O
time O
and O
most O
importantly O
- O
GOOD O
FOOD O
! O

The O
kind O
that's O
so O
old O
the O
lifts O
only O
stop O
at O
every O
two O
floors O
. O

The O
first O
: O
we O
have O
a O
soup O
, O
grouper B
fish I
broth I
with I
ginger I
, I
onion I
and I
Silken I
tofu I
. O

The O
carrot B
cake I
was O
also O
over-starched O
and O
not O
quite O
as O
soft O
as O
I'd O
like O
them O
. O

Service O
was O
prompt O
and O
efficient O
, O
I O
asked O
for O
extra O
bowls O
and O
spoons O
and O
they O
were O
promptly O
supplied O
. O

In O
Hong O
Kong O
Cantopop O
, O
there O
is O
Four O
Heavenly O
Kings O
( O
) O
namely O
Jacky O
Cheung O
, O
Aaron O
Kwok O
, O
Andy O
Lau O
and O
Leon O
Lai O
. O

We O
were O
totally O
satisfied O
with O
our O
Buffet O
Dim O
Sum O
Lunch O
at O
Cherry O
Garden O
, O
first O
visit O
but O
definitely O
will O
be O
back O
for O
more O
. O

While O
the O
dumpling O
was O
filled O
generously O
with O
tender O
pieces O
of O
meat O
and O
shiitake O
mushroom O
, O
we O
were O
a O
little O
disappointed O
that O
the O
rice O
was O
a O
tad O
soggy O
and O
the O
entire O
dumpling O
tasted O
rather O
bland O
. O

Taking O
a O
slow O
and O
careful O
bite O
of O
the O
delicate-looking O
Dim O
Sum O
, O
it O
was O
yet O
another O
pleasant O
gastronomical O
experience O
while O
tasting O
the O
savory O
soup O
oozing O
out O
of O
the O
Xiao B
Long I
Bao I
. O

Another O
common O
scene O
is O
the O
lady O
boss O
will O
actually O
scold O
and O
shout O
at O
the O
staffs O
from O
the O
counter O
in O
front O
of O
the O
customers O
, O
I O
was O
( O
un O
) O
lucky O
enough O
to O
catch O
this O
show O
in O
time O
. O

No O
shortchanging O
, O
they O
stuffed O
the O
dumpling O
full O
of O
prawns O
, O
fresh O
sizable O
prawns O
. O

but O
waiting O
time O
is O
alright O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
is O
an O
unpretentious O
hole-in-the-wall O
dimsum O
place O
that O
reflects O
the O
ambience O
in O
HK O
. O

Red O
Star's O
Dim O
Sum O
is O
one O
of O
my O
favourite O
Dim O
Sum O
spots O
in O
Singapore O
. O

so O
while O
we O
are O
in O
the O
car O
, O
we O
turned O
on O
the O
blackberry O
, O
searched O
for O
red O
star O
on O
the O
hgw O
website O
, O
found O
the O
place O
, O
and O
diverted O
to O
chin O
swee O
road O
! O

Remind O
me O
of O
Teochew O
style O
porridge O
. O

! O

When O
we O
just O
finished O
the O
last O
dish O
and O
we O
were O
still O
chewing O
the O
food O
in O
our O
mouths O
, O
the O
staff O
came O
and O
clear O
our O
plates O
! O

This O
was O
, O
one O
of O
the O
many O
, O
different O
renditions O
of O
har B
gau I
we O
would O
see O
today O
. O

Will O
be O
back O
! O

My O
parents O
loved O
it O
as O
well O
! O

While O
most O
of O
the O
steamed O
stuff O
did O
not O
entice O
me O
much O
due O
to O
the O
thick O
and O
sticky O
skin O
, O
I O
was O
quite O
satisfied O
with O
the O
egg B
tarts I
, O
porridge B
, O
pudding B
and O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
huge O
rotund O
polo B
bun I
. O

Just O
look O
at O
the O
yellowish O
and O
gooey O
egg O
yolk O
and O
custard O
wrapped O
in O
a O
soft O
and O
fluffy O
outer O
bun O
. O

We O
took O
note O
that O
all O
the O
families O
around O
us O
were O
being O
served O
the O
requested O
wine O
. O

If O
I O
recall O
correctly O
, O
it's O
their O
own O
invention O
. O

This O
place O
is O
great O
to O
while O
your O
time O
away O
as O
you O
slow O
down O
to O
eat O
/ O
chat O
with O
friends O
/ O
family O
. O

' O
We O
were O
speechless O
... O

It O
is O
recommended O
to O
eat O
the O
peking B
dumplings I
fast O
before O
it O
cools O
as O
the O
skin O
would O
get O
too O
hard O
. O

And O
the O
is O
super O
delicious O
! O

Cherry O
Garden O
hits O
all O
the O
right O
spots O
! O

I O
am O
sure O
that O
when O
Dim O
Sum O
is O
mentioned O
most O
of O
you O
would O
be O
thinking O
of O
the O
likes O
of O
Peach O
Garden O
, O
Peony O
Jade O
, O
Lei O
Garden O
, O
Red O
Star O
or O
East O
Ocean O
. O

Also O
, O
what O
I O
heard O
was O
that O
the O
locals O
doesn't O
even O
visit O
THW O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
( O
only O
tourists O
) O
- O
where's O
the O
5 O
star O
thingy O
came O
from O
you O
tell O
me O
? O

Great O
setting O
with O
prompt O
service O
though O
the O
service O
staff O
could O
do O
more O
with O
a O
smile O
. O

Outside O
crunchy O
, O
inside O
soft O

Crisp-fried B
scallops I
with I
salted I
egg I
yolk I
and I
crispy I
Asian I
spice I
crumbs I
, O
$ O
26 O
delighted O
me O
with O
the O
crackling O
crispy O
crust O
and O
the O
soft O
supple O
scallops O
within O
. O

A O
glint O
enters O
their O
eyes O
and O
excitement O
sweeps O
their O
faces O
that O
is O
usually O
followed O
by O
coos O
and O
nods O
of O
approval O
. O

Anyone O
remembers O
the O
advertisement O
on O
the O
papers O
that O
highlights O
the O
American B
Duck I
dish O
that O
they O
are O
still O
serving O
? O

And O
this O
is O
coming O
from O
someone O
who's O
not O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
carbs O
. O

Assorted O
melamine O
plates O
and O
dirty O
looking O
tea O
pots O
are O
common O
sight O
here O
. O

This O
restaurant O
offerred O
us O
a O
very O
good O
service O
, O
even O
the O
choices O
of O
food O
is O
quite O
limited O
. O

As O
usual O
, O
it O
was O
impossible O
to O
get O
the O
attention O
of O
wait O
staff O
. O

I O
love O
the O
old O
skool O
feel O
, O
Aunties O
calling O
out O
what O
they O
have O
in O
their O
food O
trolleys O
and O
they O
speak O
Cantonese O
! O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
better O
Yum O
Cha O
restaurants O
in O
Singapore O
. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
the O
type O
to O
eat O
this O
, O
you O
should O
skip O
it O
totally O
& O
let O
the O
rest O
have O
a O
go O
at O
it O
. O

Have O
I O
painted O
a O
vivid O
enough O
picture O
of O
the O
ambience O
for O
ya O
or O
do O
I O
hafta O
keep O
up O
with O
this O
lousy O
, O
ungifted O
imagination O
of O
mine O
? O

Overall O
, O
someplace O
that O
I O
doubt O
I O
will O
every O
go O
back O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
was O
not O
a O
big O
fan O
of O
chives O
- O
I O
would O
leave O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
dumpling O
to O
your O
own O
imagination O
. O

a O
belated O
post O
... O
Feels O
so O
much O
like O
the O
oldies O

It's O
a O
refreshing O

down O

The O
auntie O
and O
uncle O

are O
very O
attentive O
and O
prompt O
. O

When O
you O

The O
HK B
Iced I
Milk I
Tea I
was O
a O
chilled O
Milk B
Tea I
served O
in O
a O
bowl O
of O
iced O
water O
, O
ensuring O
that O
the O
tea O
remains O
cool O
without O
being O
diluted O
over O
time O
. O

The O
skin O
is O
soft O
and O
the O
size O
is O
just O
right O
- O
any O
bigger O
and O
it O
would O
be O
too O
filling O
. O

( O
We O
paid O
for O
2 O
bottles O
cuz O
they O
merrily O
topped O
up O
the O
water O
over O
and O
over O
again O
and O
even O
opened O
a O
new O
bottle O
) O
But O
that O
was O
really O
our O
mistake O
. O

The O
consomm O
had O
the O
right O
viscosity O
and O
good O
amount O
of O
dainty O
honshimeiji O
mushrooms O
and O
itty O
dried O
scallop O
shreds O
swimming O
in O
it O
. O

We O
came O
by O
here O
under O
the O
recommendation O
of O
a O
friend O
. O

They O
were O
very O
generous O
with O
the O
durian O
fillings O
too O
. O

Turns O
out O
.. O
it O
is O
like O
spring O
roll O
, O
the O
salty O
fillingsnot O
the O
mashy O
yam O
but O
more O
of O
those O
hakka O
stir O
fry O
style O
which O
i O
prefer O
. O

They O
might O
not O
look O
set O
to O
impress O
the O
crowd O
but O
it O
speaks O
clearly O
in O
the O
taste O
. O

They O
do O
have O
creative O
dishes O
but O
the O
food O
was O
not O
served O
hot O
. O

Although O
it O
has O
been O
renovated O
a O
few O
times O
, O
the O
place O
just O
give O
you O
a O
feeling O
that O
you O
are O
back O
in O
the O
1970 O
' O
s O
era O
. O

One O
thing O
I O
like O
the O
place O
about O
was O
the O
service O
speed O
. O

twice O
at O
plaza O
sing O
and O
once O
at O
west O
gate O
. O

Nothing O
taste O
good O
here O
. O

( O
But O
why O
not O
visit O
Beancurd O
City O
instead O
? O

It O
was O
also O
smaller O
in O
size O
and O
at O
S O
$ O
1.50 O
per O
bun O
, O
the O
next O
question O
to O
ask O
would O
be O
, O
how O
was O
the O
filling O
? O

Apparently O
, O
this O
jelly O
cheesecake O
is O
also O
known O
as O
jellyhearts O
elsewhere O
. O

Just O
that O
probably O
the O
sauce O
is O
nicer O
. O

Freshly O
fried O
and O
thus O
crispy O
and O
burning O
hot O
, O
every O
bite O
gives O
you O
a O
crunching O
sensation O
. O

I O
don't O
think O
I O
will O
go O
back O
there O
again O
. O

We O
were O
so O
hooked O
that O
we O
ordered O
9 O

the O
last O
of O
the O
4 O
signature O
dishes O
was O
the O
steamed B

$ O
3.80 O
, O
which O
is O
kinda O
like O
a O

? O

In O
addition O
to O
their O
drool-worthy O
morsels O
, O
the O
dim O
sum O
buffet O
brunch O
offers O
a O
selection O
of O
appetizers O
, O
soups O
, O

and O

Unlike O
those O
that O
are O
so O
mashed O
up O

I O
would O
really O
prefer O
this O
! O

Let O

start O

buying O

I O
think O
the O

have O
been O
around O
for O
quite O
some O
time O

We O
had O
to O
chase O
for O
our O
drinks O
repeatedly O
after O
we O
d O
finished O
our O
meal O
I O
was O
that O

did O
not O

all O
these O
while O

much O
prefer O
the O
gooey O
sticky O
type O
of O

. O

Not O
that O
pretty O
but O
it's O
tasty O
all O
right O
. O

Both O
tasted O
nice O
with O
the O
winter O
melon O
more O
refreshing O
& O
you O
could O
taste O
the O
sweetness O
of O
the O
ingredients O
. O

The O
beancurd O
skin O
has O
its O
own O
unique O
taste O
, O
and O
when O
steamed O
, O
the O
juice O
of O
the O
meat O
and O
prawn O
is O
absorbed O
by O
the O
bean O
curd O

creating O
this O
extremely O
juicy O
meat O
taste O
when O
you O
bite O
into O

Restaurant O
from O
Hong O

that O
is O
supposedly O
offering O
delicious O
Dim O
Sum O
at O
affordable O
price O
. O

It O
went O
really O
well O
with O
the O
pork O
filling O
and O
had O
just O
enough O
kick O
for O
that O
oomph O
factor O
. O

Their O
Steamed B

is O
super O
moist O
and O
fluffy O
. O

On O
a O
cooling O
night O
, O
it's O
good O
to O
seat O
outdoors O

Why O
can't O
my O
friends O
go O
shopping O
around O
Plaza O
Singapura O
while O
one O
of O
us O
waits O
for O
our O
table O
? O

If O
you O
want O
authentic O
Cantonese O
food O
, O
Red O
Star O
is O
definitely O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

Talking O
about O
seniors O
who O
are O
exceptionally O
observant O
! O

Really O
don't O
understand O
what O
the O
hype O
is O
about O
for O
this O
place O
. O

This O
was O
a O
really O
interesting O
drink O
because O
the O
tea O
is O
served O
chilled O
in O
a O
dish O
of O
ice O
, O
so O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
your O
drink O
being O
diluted O
as O
the O
ice O
melts O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
trying O
the O
BBQ B
pork I
buns I
-- O
the O
inside O
is O
nice O
, O
but O
be O
warned O
the O
outside O
is O
strangely O
sweet O
. O

Only O
the O
difference O
was O
, O
less O
crowded O
than O
previously O
used O
to O
be O
. O

The O
liberal O
marbling O
of O
soft O
juicy O
fat O
that O
melted O
in O
the O
mouth O
with O
just O
a O
gentle O
flick O
of O
the O
tongue O
. O

Be O
careful O
not O
to O
burn O
your O
tongue O
though O
. O

We O
took O
about O
10mins O
to O
decide O
what O
to O
order O
as O
we O
just O
couldn't O
decide O
! O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
place O
to O
dine O
that O
is O
' O
slightly O
reminisant O
' O
of O
dining O
at O
a O
Hong O
Kong O
cafe O
, O
you O
can O
come O
here O
. O

They O
tasted O
good O
but O
not O
over O
the O
top O
WOW O
! O

After O
this O
everything O
went O
downhill O
. O

The O
maximum O
waiting O
time O
is O
~ O
5 O
minutes O
. O

Being O
a O
prawn O
lover O
and O
a O
beancurd O
sheet O
lover O
, O
this O
dish O
totally O
captivated O
my O
palette O
. O

Another O
favourite O
of O
my O
friend's O
. O

For O
full O
review O
and O
pictures O
please O
read O
: O

Now O
, O
this O
is O
steamed O
and O
the O
DRIED O
scallop O
can O
only O
be O
found O
in O
a O
small O
dish O
mixed O
with O
XO O
chilli O
. O

But O
they O
lacked O
the O
wow O
! O

The O
char B
siew I
bao I
, O
espeically O
the O
one O
that O
smell O
of O
rose O
is O
unforgettable O
and O
also O
don't O
forget O
the O
wala B
wala I
porridge I
. O

Personally O
found O
the O
skin O
too O
dry O
and O
shriveled O
. O

Back O
to O
the O
siew B
mai I
, O
the O
mini O
abalone O
was O
tender O
and O
flavorful O
. O

I O
wouldn't O
go O
back O
. O

then O
i O
also O
questioned O
the O
notion O
of O
asking O
us O
to O
eat O
this O
chicken O
( O
tendons O
and O
all O
) O
with O
just O
a O
pair O
of O
chopsticks O
, O
when O
it O
seemed O
to O
be O
begging O
for O
a O
fork O
and O
knife O
to O
operate O
on O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
must-tries O
are O
glutinous B
rice I
with I
sausage I
& I
chicken I
and O
carrot B
cake I
with I
XO I
sauce I
. O

However O
, O
this O
doesn't O
stop O
people O
from O
visiting O
it O
. O

Or O
you O
will O
never O
know O
what O
you O
are O
missing O
! O

He O
said O
instead O
If O
you O
do O
it O
like O
this O
, O
it O
will O
take O
too O
long O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
prefer O
ungrinded O
meat O
as O
I O
prefer O
the O
crunchiness O
and O
succulent O
elasticity O
of O
the O
original O
flesh O
. O

You'll O
still O
be O
able O
to O
finish O
them O
and O
may O
even O
want O
more O
if O
you O
love O
durians O
. O

We O
hear O
the O
waitilist O
for O
this O
restaurant O
can O
go O
up O
to O
a O
few O
weeks O
best O
book O
now O
. O

Despite O
a O
blend O
of O
pork O
, O
chives O
and O
prawns O
making O
up O
the O
fillings O
, O
these O
chive B
rolls I
were O
sorely O
lacking O
in O
the O
taste O
of O
chives O
. O

The O
food O
is O
good O
and O
the O
value O
for O
money O
also O
. O

( O
They O
don't O
charge O
GST O
or O
Service O
Charge O
too O
. O
) O

Char B
Siew I
Soh I
: O
Two O
huge O
, O
flaky O
pastries O
before O
we O
cut O
it O
into O
halves O
, O
thus O
able O
to O
see O
the O
juicy O
red O
meat O
inside O
. O

First O
Review O
: O
Not O
only O
cheap O
, O
and O
they O
have O
great O
food O
too O
. O

They O
came O
warm O
and O
custard O
still O
liquid O
and O
gooey O
. O

I'm O
not O
sure O
why O
. O

you O
asked O
them O
for O
the O
menu O
, O
they O
tell O
you O
go O
in O
front O
take O
yourself O
okay O

Portions O
were O
enough O
for O
2 O
person O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
glutinous O
rice O
and O
in O
most O
places O
, O
most O
of O
the O
glutinous O
rice O
was O
hard O
. O

Considering O
that O
the O
prices O
of O
the O
Dim O
Sum O
items O
were O
close O
or O
around O
restaurant O
prices O
, O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
more O
from O
the O
eatery O
since O
there O
was O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
disappointing O
misses O
. O

now O
, O
you O
know O
there O
was O
a O
time O
where O
i O
thought O
double-boiled O
simple O
meant O
boiling O
twice O
, O
but O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
later O
kindly O
corrected O
me O
that O
double-boiled O
essentially O
means O
placing O
the O
ingredients O
( O
in O
this O
case O
the O
shark's O
fin O
) O
within O
a O
ceramic O
jar O
that O
is O
immersed O
in O
a O
water O
bath O
in O
a O
pot O
that O
is O
then O
boiled O
. O

It O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
chicken O
puff O
kind O
of O
pastries O
from O
French O
patisseries O
. O

Of O
course O
if O
not O
for O
the O
roasted B
duck I
, O
it'll O
be O
cheaper O
. O

Lastly O

king O

all O
dishes O

Hubby O
and O
I O
have O
brought O
our O
overseas O
friends O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
Singapore O
to O
this O
resturant O
. O

First O
glance O
at O
menu O
.. O
very O
limited O
selection O
.. O
alll O
crossed O
out O
and O
barely O
15 O
items O
available O
to O
choose O
from O
. O

Was O
contemplating O
whether O
to O
buy O
the O
XO O
sauce O
home O
, O
which O
was O
about O
$ O
20 O
a O
bottle O
, O
would O
taste O
quite O
nice O
with O
porridge O
. O

The O
food O
was O
great O
. O

The O
carts O
go O
by O
frequently O
but O
if O
you're O
stuck O
in O
a O
little O
ulu O
corner O
, O
you'll O
find O
yourself O
waving O
for O
attention O
alot O
. O

Too O

will O
have O

of O

in O
it O
. O

Don't O
waste O
ur O
penny O
on O
this O
. O

Quality O
of O
food O
is O
only O
average O
, O
given O
that O
the O
pricing O
is O
around O

4 O

If O
you O
are O
finding O
some O
nice O

and O
good O
service O
, O
this O

but O
still O
it O
is O
a O
great O
place O
for O
you O
to O
bring O
your O
family O
esp O
your O
parents O
! O

They O
made O
their O
own O
carrot B
cakes I
with O
scallop O
and O
sausage O
mash O
. O

The O
food O
was O
served O
within O
5min O
after O
placing O
our O
orders O
. O

we O
also O
had O
e O
fried B
pork I
chops I
/ O
ribs O
which O
r O
also O
yummy O
as O
it O
is O
again O
lightly O
fried O
hence O
retaining O

meat O

without O

oil O
overpowering O
e O

This O
restaurant O
selling O
best O
shaomai B
according O
to O
my O
taste O
. O

The O
was O
not O
even O
crisp O
at O
all O
. O

If O
only O
the O
place O
don't O
have O
this O
restrictive O
two O
slot O
timing O
thing O
... O

( O
victor O
s O
king B
prawn I
dumpling I
$ O
4.50 O
) O
the O
dumpling O
was O
so O
tightly O
packed O
with O
filling O
it O
seemed O
like O
it O
s O
going O
to O
burst O
. O

See O
my O
pictures O
here O

We O
told O
her O
we O
were O
FORCED O
to O
leave O
and O
said O
the O
service O
was O
lousy O
! O

The O
service O
was O
not O
bad O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
standard O
dim O
sum O
dishes O
, O
such O
as O
har B
gao I
and O
siew B
Mai I
were O
average O
. O

Ordered O
the O
Custard B
Bun I
. O

anyway O
, O
the O
more O
memorable O
ones O
were O
the O
typical O
dimsum O
dishes O
. O

Downside O
... O
its O
so O
popular O
that O
it's O
always O
packed O
especially O
on O
weekends O
, O
even O
during O
lunch O
on O
weekdays O
! O
! O

Some O
of O
it O
is O
actually O
quite O
OK O
. O

Waitress O
- O
Down O
right O
rude O
and O
bochup O
- O
Requested O
the O
auntie O
to O
refill O
the O
hot O
water O
to O
my O
tea O
pot O
and O
she O
looked O
at O
me O
, O
pretended O
nothing O
has O
been O
heard O
and O
walked O
away O
! O

u're O
better O
off O
eating O
that O
. O

What O
is O
dimsum O
without O
your O
Har B
Gaws I
, O
right O
? O

Personally O
thought O
that O
it O
would O
taste O
better O
if O
it O
was O
soaked O
in O
soy O
sauce O
. O

But O
everyone O
started O
getting O
impatient O
when O
the O
clock O
slowly O
ticked O
towards O
10:45 O
and O
yet O
we O
were O
not O
allowed O
to O
go O
in O
. O

Great O
food O
, O
ambience O
and O
service O
. O

I O
found O
this O
ridiculous O
and O
decided O
not O
to O
patronize O
the O
shop O
as O
there O
was O
clearly O
no O
sign O
over O
there O
to O
indicate O
that O
the O
queue O
should O
start O
in O
front O
of O
another O
shop O
. O

Or O
translated O
into O
English O
, O
deep O
fried O
vermicelli O
rice O
cake O
. O

Don't O
just O
try O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
i O
personally O
think O
their O
Cantonese O
food O
taste O
much O
better O
than O
their O
dim O
sum O
. O

However O
, O
I O
went O
back O
recently O
and O
found O
that O
the O
taste O
and O
texture O
is O
no O
longer O
the O
same O
as O
the O
past O
. O

I O
presumed O
the O
prawns O
are O
the O
same O
as O
the O
ones O
in O
the O
har B
gau I
, O
and O
they O
are O
fresh O
and O
good O
, O
pity O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
cheong O
fun O
though O
. O

I O
will O
order O
for O
you O
. O

This O
should O
be O
the O
same O
soup O
they O
use O
for O
their O
Spicy B
& I
Sour I
Soup I
La I
Mian I
( O
$ O

) O
. O

Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
does O
help O
alleviate O
any O
impatience O
by O
having O
stools O
readily O
available O
and O
having O
its O
staff O
manage O
the O
queue O
by O
taking O
orders O
right O
before O
your O
turn O
is O
up O
. O

Total O
damage O
: O
$ O
30.90 O
they O
jus O
updated O
their O
menu O
! O

Not O
fantastic O
enough O
to O
rave O
about O
, O
but O
no O
compliants O
either O
. O

So O
there O
is O
actually O
enough O
seats O
immediately O
at O
9am O
for O
the O
first O
batch O
of O
queuers O
but O
everyone O
must O
be O
present O
before O
they O
allow O
you O
in O
. O

Took O
advantage O
of O
a O
UOB O
voucher O
and O
decided O
to O
check O
out O
the O
place O
. O

Though O
the O
lady O
boss O
and O
this O
younger O
looking O
auntie O
will O
always O
be O
their O
usual O
cocky O
self O
. O

Friend O
thought O
this O
sucked O
, O
but O
not O
because O
it O
wasn't O
nice O
. O

Dim O
sum O
are O
yummy O
and O
good O
value O
for O
money O
. O

By O
far O
the O
star O
of O
the O
show O
was O
the O
yam B
puff I
. O

The O
queue O
stretched O
on O
for O
quite O
a O
bit O
during O
weekend O
lunch O
. O

The O
mini O
abalone O
which O
tasted O
rather O
chewy O
and O
accompanied O
rather O
well O
with O
the O
Siew B
Mai I
, O
which O
was O
rather O
well O
comprised O
of O
Pork O
meat O
filling O
and O
Mushroom O
. O

Ironically O
, O
as O
we O
were O
leaving O
, O
a O
smiley O
mid-aged O
server O
came O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
and O
took O
the O
stacked O
chairs O
, O
commenting O
that O
we O
are O
leaving O
. O

Fried B
Custard I
Pumpkin I
( O
$ O
1.80 O
) O
- O
I O
feel O
that O
custard O
is O
best O
eaten O
soft O
and O
flowy O
. O

Got O
a O
seat O
in O
the O
booth O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
building O
on O
reputation O
but O
not O
food O
quality O
. O

I'm O
pretty O
sure O
that O
Radish O
was O
used O
because O
there O
were O
prominent O
strands O
of O
radish O
all O
within O
the O
Fried B
Carrot I
Cake I
. O

The O
custard O
just O
flows O
out O
of O
the O
bun O
in O
the O
most O
glorious O
shade O
of O
yellow O
. O

But O
we O
ordered O
13 O
dishes O
and O
they O
served O
them O
almost O
all O
at O
once O
. O

The O
food O
was O
also O
quite O
expensive O
. O

Service O
is O
good O
. O

The O
good O
thing O
is O
, O
there's O
more O
meat O
than O
rice O
, O
so O
you O
don't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
filling O
up O
on O
this O
yummy O
dish O
too O
quickly O
. O

Second O
Review O
: O
I O
went O
on O
last O
saturday O
and O
tried O
different O
dishes O
again O
. O

Go O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

The O
second O
was O
a O

Jiao I
with I
chicken I
meat I
and I
vegetables I
, O
which O
was O
slightly O
better O
than O
the O
first O
one O
because O
the O
chicken O
provided O
some O
fibre O
to O
chew O
on O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
will O
definitely O
be O
back O
again O
for O
more O
and O
! O

The O
dim O
sums O
were O
piping O
hot O
when O
they O
came O
and O
service O
was O
fast O

I O

On O

i O
spend O
about O

so O
its O

Let O

of O

There O
weren't O
alot O
of O
chinese O
restaurants O
here O
available O
for O
fantastic O
dim O

but O
was O
recommended O
Victor's O

by O
my O
colleague O
so O
took O
a O
drive O
down O
to O
Sunshine O

search O
of O
it O
. O

However O
, O
out O
of O
the O

I O
had O
, O
the O
siew B
mai I
was O
dry O
and O
the O
spare B
ribs I
rice I
was O
bland O
. O

Be O
warned O
you O
have O
to O
queue O
and O
wait O
on O
the O
weekends O
. O

The O
meats O
served O
were O
so O
succulent O
, O
crispy O
and O
marinated O
nicely O
. O

without O
budget O
issues O
or O
dietary O
constraints O
and O
the O
waiter O
with O
the O
weird O
tasseled O
hat O
will O
know O
exactly O
what O
and O
how O
many O
dishes O
to O
serve O
up O
. O

Every O
item O
is O
at O
least O
4.80 O
for O
3 O
pcs O
vs O
4.00 O
for O
2 O
pcs O
at O
TANG'S O
Man O

Restaurant O
... O

With O
its O
thin O
but O
firm O
skin O
, O
tender O
meat O
and O
tasty O
soup O
, O
the O
Xiao B
Long I

is O
definitely O
a O
must-try O
! O

Don't O
be O
a O
fool O
, O
Don't O
go O
any O
more O
. O

It's O
always O
a O
happy O
gathering O
and O
we O
always O
look O
forward O
to O
this O
feast O

I O

that O
that O

be O
my O

I O
like O
the O
crispy B

. O

Of O
those O
who O
ate O
this O
dish O
, O
most O
felt O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
special O

DIE O
DIE O
MUST O
TRY O
! O

Although O
they O
did O
forget O
to O
take O
down O
one O
of O
our O
orders O
, O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
a O
blessing O
in O
disguise O
, O
as O
my O
family O
was O
pretty O
stuffed O
by O
the O
time O
our O
carbohydrate-rich O
dish O
( O
vermicelli O
) O
came O
. O
=) O

However O
it O
took O
FOREVER O
for O
it O
to O
come O
be O
prepared O
for O
pretty O
tardy O
service O
as O
the O
waitresses O
were O
obviously O
finding O
it O
hard O
to O
cope O
with O
the O
crowd O
and O
there O
was O
only O
one O
lady O
making O
the O
drinks O
. O

The O
staff O
at O
the O
reception O
is O
friendly O
while O
the O
others O
are O
quite O
okay O
in O
terms O
of O

Char B
Siew I
Bun I
One O
of O
my O
fave O
as O
the O
bun O
is O
just O
so O
soft O
& O
fluffy O
, O
the O
interior O
was O
loaded O
with O
char O
siew O
fillings O
& O
the O
sauce O
was O
so O
juicy O
that O
it O
could O
drip O
onto O
you O
at O
times O
, O
so O
ladies O
beware O
! O

But O
of O
course O
, O
she O
hasn't O
eaten O

( O
still O
the O
unsurpassed O
Chinese O

standard O
for O

) O

The O
Fried B
Shrimp I
Dumpling I
was O
crunchy O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
and O
when O
you O
bite O
into O
the O
shrimp O
, O
it O
was O
crunchy O
and O
succelent O
. O

Even O
when O
the O
place O
is O
packed O
, O
the O
staffs O
are O
still O
attentive O
and O
fast O
. O

You O
will O
never O
believe O
in O

that O
just O
within O
the O
narrow O

The O

The O

the O

was O
when O
the O
final O

came O
, O
the O
amount O
for O
the O
entire O
family O
was O
less O
than O
the O
cost O
of O
4 O
pints O

These O
triangular O
pastries O
came O
with O
hints O
of O
crispiness O
, O
especially O
around O
the O
corners O
, O
which O
made O
them O
immensely O
tasty O
. O

To O

honest O

It O

that O
had O
a O

I O
really O
dig O
the O

- O
a O

The O

Guess O

? O
The O

finally O
remembered O
vaguely O
that O
I O
asked O

The O
grand O
total O
of O
3 O
distinct O

of O
this O

totally O
whetted O
my O
appetite O

Again O
, O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
they O
ran O
out O

When O
you O
bite O

you O
can O
hear O
your O
own O
teeth O
crushing O
the O
crust O
. O

Please O
boycott O
till O
they O
learn O
! O

This O
is O
a O
must O
order O
dish O
too O
! O

It O
was O
so O
unappetizing O
that O
I O
only O
managed O
to O
finish O
half O

We O
then O
accepted O
foul O

while O
the O
wait O
for O
our O

As O
usual O
, O
I O
got O
curious O
and O
the O
only O
way O
to O
know O
more O
was O
to O
taste O
the O
food O
for O
myself O

It's O
all O
about O

the O

stacking O

my O

while O
I O
was O
struggling O
to O
pack O
the O

myself O

I O
wanted O
to O

the O

It O
must O
be O
so O
expensive O
coz O
they O
only O
give O
a O
teeny O

it O

no O

one O

These O

The O

is O
a O
traditional O

eatery O

which O
means O
that O

should O
come O

with O
some O
shredded O

going O
at O

was O
atrocious O
! O

The O
tea O
is O
dismal O
, O
but O
in O
a O
nostalgic O
way O
: O
this O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
days O
before O
refinement O
was O
the O
norm O
, O
before O
places O
like O
Imperial O
Treasure O
spoiled O
our O
palates O
with O
proper O
tea O

in O
their O
pots O

12.30 O

topped O
with O
slices O
of O
char O
siew O
which O
were O
savory O
and O
sweet O
, O
the O
fluffy O
rice O
was O
flavorful O
though O
the O
size O
of O
hard-boiled O
egg O
could O
ve O
been O
bigger O
. O

At O
least O
I O
know O
there O
will O
be O
better O
service O
. O

TH O
, O
think O
other O
wise O
and O
give O
it O
two O
thumbs O
up O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
fairly O
accessible O
due O
to O
the O
wide O
range O
of O
buses O
and O
close O
proximity O
to O
Lavender O
MRT O
. O

The O
food O
is O
nothing O
to O
brag O
about O
but O
you O
can O
be O
guaranteed O
freshness O
. O

This O
is O
by O
far O
one O
of O
the O
worse O
dim O
sum O
I O
have O
had O

The O
place O
was O
pretty O
full O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O

Seated O
within O
15 O
min O

This O
is O
definitely O
a O
restaurant O
that O
would O
delight O
and O
impress O
Mums O
and O
Dads O
from O
overseas O
. O

Food O
quality O
was O
generally O
a O
little O

Feel O

them O

they O
would O
be O
more O
than O
happy O
to O

you O
. O

the O
vermicelli O
was O
perfectly O
balanced O
and O
tasty O
, O
and O
i O
liked O
how O
the O
shredded O
egg O
strips O
brought O
a O
freshness O
and O
change O
in O
texture O
to O
the O
dish O
. O

Porridge O
- O
so O
salty O
. O

My O
first O
impression O
of O
the O
place O
? O

The O
day O
finally O
came O
when O
we O
decided O
to O
abandon O
this O
stall O
for O
good O
. O

One O
set O
back O
is O
no O
reservation O
of O
table O
is O
entertained O
. O

As O
for O
the O
sticky O
rice O
, O
totally O
cannot O
make O
it O
. O

Half O
the O
dishes O
never O
came O
even O
after O
asking O
the O
waiter O
and O
owner O
to O
check O
our O
orders O
. O

I O
loved O
this O
horfun B
! O

The O
Braised B
Homemade I
Tofu I
topped I
with I
Minced I
Pork I
and I
Preserved I
Vegetables I
was O
salty O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
preserved O
vegetables O
in O
the O
gravy O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
I O
have O
to O
qualify O
that O
it O
was O
quite O
a O
special O
occasion O
and O
we O
went O
with O
the O
most O
expensive O
set O
, O
but O
you O
know O
... O

Prices O
were O
affordable O
One O
minor O
hiccup O
was O
that O
the O
waitress O
mixed O
up O
2 O
of O
our O
dishes O
. O

Good O
place O
to O
explore O
chinese O
food O
at O
weird O

of O

, O
especially O
after O
a O
late O

LOL O

The O
interior O
was O
much O
like O
the O
inns O
of O
imperial O
China O
and O
the O
service O
staff O
was O
clad O
in O
costumes O
specific O
to O
the O
era O
. O

If O
you're O
looking O
for O
high O
quality O
unique O
food O
with O
top-notch O
service O
and O
classy O
oriental O
ambience O
, O
look O
no O
further O
. O

One O
price O
, O

for O
the O
value O
of O

The O
restaurant O
was O
busy O
, O
small O
, O
and O
packed O
. O

a O
perfectly O
flaky O
crust O
, O
lightly O
crumbly O
, O
slightly O
sweet O
, O
and O
one O
bite O
gives O
way O
to O
deliciously O
tasty O
char O

within O
it O
. O

Dim O

is O
the O
food O
to O
eat O
here O
. O

Appetizers O
& O
special O
dishes O
were O
a O
one-time O
order O
only O
. O

The O
batter O
has O
a O
taste O
like O
crackers O
to O
me O
. O

To O
cope O
with O
the O
high O
volume O
demand O
, O
this O
Singapore O
branch O
, O
much O
like O
its O
predecessors O
, O
will O
also O
not O
take O
reservations O
but O
cater O
seats O
via O
a O
first-come O
first-serve O
basis O
. O

I O
do O
not O
see O
how O
this O
can O
be O
a O
star O
item O
, O
but O
perhaps O
it's O
just O
on O
this O
occasion O
that O
it O
fell O
short O
. O

Similarly O
, O
I O
love O
the O
gravy O
for O
its O
taste O
and O
for O
its O
inability O
to O
turn O
starchy O
upon O
cooling O
. O

We O
were O
given O
this O
narrow O
space O
seats O
and O
well O
it O
was O
not O
really O
a O
big O
concern O
. O

There O
were O
4 O
of O
us O
and O
that O
table O
is O
meant O
for O
4 O
pax O
, O
however O
there O
were O
only O
3 O
chairs O
. O

I O
liked O
their O
signature O
glutinous B

chicken I
and I

found O
their O
other O

a O

too O
soft O

wet O
but O
interesting O
and O
enjoyable O
nonetheless O

I O
found O

loved O
their O

even O
though O
I O
m O
not O
a O
big O
fan O
of O

after O
years O
of O
having O
to O
endure O
bloody O

on O
every O

in O
the O

Exit O

Who O
wants O
to O
pay O
so O

and O

through O
the O

? O

This O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
very O
few O
places O
in O
Singapore O
, O
that O

Will O

In O
all O

I O

I O

about O
15 O

and O
make O
sure O
you O

really O
good O

has O
a O

the O
fresh O

was O
tender O
and O
soft O

It's O
a O
simple O
place O
where O
to O

would O
mean O
eating O

One O
of O
the O
premier O
Chinese O
Restaurant O
that O
is O
also O
famous O
for O
it's O
Dim O
Sum O
. O

Highly O
unrecommended O
. O

Try O
it O
and O
if O
it O
does O
not O
satisfy O
you O
in O
terms O
of O
quantity O
, O
you O
can O
even O
ask O
to O
takeaway O
and O
they O
will O
sell O
you O
frozen O
ones O
which O
are O
equally O
good O
after O
you O
steam O
it O
DIY O
at O
hoome O
! O

Finally O
got O
to O
taste O
this O
internally O
know O
dim O

brand O
! O

Served O
up O
with O
a O
piece O
of O
sea O
cucumber O
on O
a O
bed O
of O
vegetables O
. O

If O
you O
are O
ever O
around O
the O
area O
it O
would O
be O
good O
to O
drop O
by O
and O
try O
their O
dishes O
. O

But O
well O
, O
this O
is O
amazing O
sticky O
, O
soft O
and O
fragrant O
. O

Strong O
preference O
for O
the O
Fish B
Maw I
Soup I
over O
the O
Dumpling B
Soup I
. O

The O
rice O
had O
a O
very O
sticky O
texture O
and O
was O
flavourful O
. O

the O
sorbet O
had O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
sourness O
and O
complemented O
the O
herbal O
jelly O
, O
aloe O
vera O
and O
fresh O
fruits O
perfectly O
. O

Fortunately O
, O
that O
day O
there O
wasn't O
any O
queue O
. O

Having O
ranted O
on O
the O
waiting O
, O
I O
must O
say O
that O
I O
will O
be O
revisiting O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
for O
their O
signature O
dishes O
and O
XO O

Can O
say O
most O

are O

they O

We O
spent O

felt O
like O
I O
ate O
almost O
nothing O
, O
apart O
from O
a O
few O
pieces O
of O

It O
was O
around O
2pm O
when O
we O
arrived O
, O
and O
a O
line O
outside O
the O
restaurant O
was O
still O
prominent O
, O
even O
though O
not O
that O
bad O
. O

It O
was O
also O
interesting O
that O
the O
restaurant O
has O
traditional O
decor O
and O

that O
come O
by O
the O
table O
frequently O
with O

the O

HK O
vs O
SG O
STANDARD O
: O
I O
guess O
I O
am O
in O
the O
best O
position O
to O
give O
the O
verdict O
, O
since O
I O
just O
came O
back O
from O
Hong O
Kong O
s O
just O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
. O

I O
personally O
like O
the O
roasted O
selection O
esp O
the O
duck O
and O
its O
very O
delicate O
plum O
sauce O
, O
tangy O
enough O
with O
just O
right O
sweetness O
. O

Despite O
all O
that O
negative O
opinions O
, O
the O
casual O
diner O
in O
us O
still O
enjoy O
the O
basic O
dim O
sum O
dishes O
meeting O
the O
minimum O
standards O
of O
our O
finicky O
taste O
buds O
. O

Service O
is O
minimum O
, O
but O
the O
food O
is O
excellent O
on O
a O
good O
day O
. O

The O
Phoenix B
Claw I
and O
char B
siew I
bun I
wasn't O
too O
bad O
. O

How O
did O
I O
conclude O
this O
? O

I O
like O
to O
take O
a O
small O
bite O
, O
suck O
all O
the O
juice O
out O
and O
then O
munch O
my O

the O

is O
delicious O

affordable O
( O

Whatever O

are O
my O

in O

Cherry O
Garden O
with O
its O
dark O

and O
intimate O
Oriental O
courtyard O

is O
the O
most O
desirable O
setting O
for O

we O
liked O
the O
congee B

lean I
pork I
, I
century I

and I
salted I
egg I
( O

not O
being O
too O
salty O
(: O
i O
couldn't O
really O
taste O
any O
of O
the O
salted O
egg O
though O

i O
really O
enjoyed O
our O
dessert O
which O
was O
yam B

with I

( O

I O
think O
this O

was O
overly O

for O
the O
kind O
of O
dimsum O
they O
served O

To O
our O
shock O
, O
there O
was O

the O

He O
, O
alongside O
with O
his O
handful O
of O

slogged O

served O
with O
passion O
and O
enthusiasm O

The O
restaurant O
is O
rather O
packed O
on O
the O
weekends O
so O
if O
you're O
planning O
to O
patronize O
on O
the O
weekends O
, O
i O
would O
recommend O
you O
to O
call O
in O
advance O
to O
avoid O
disappointment O

This O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O
one O

famous O
dishes O
: O
Scallop B

together O
with O
a O
huge O
serving O
of O
fresh O

Somehow O
, O
we O
could O
not O
detect O
any O
XO O
taste O
in O
it O
, O
it O
was O
more O
like O

My O

I O
were O
looking O
for O
a O

VERDICT O
Overall O
, O
we O
are O
very O
satisfied O
with O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
and O
the O
affordable O
prices O
that O
go O
along O
with O
it O
. O

No O
one O
greets O
u O
when O
u O
arrive O
. O

Service O
: O
Dim O
sum O
is O
made O
to O
order O
( O
as O
in O
Not O
frozen O
and O
reheated O
) O
so O
it O
tends O
to O
take O
longer O
than O
a O
fast O
food O
joint O
. O

It O
may O
not O
sound O
like O
or O
even O
be O
categorised O
as O
ALOT O
OF O
FOOD O
for O
many O
out O
there O
but O
it O
sure O
is O
alot O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
2 O
people O
, O
inculding O
me O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
on O
a O
diet O
but O
then O
decided O
since O
it's O
Chinese O
New O
Year O
, O
what O
the O
heck O
! O

well O
this O

actually O
at O
the O

ordered O

It O
was O
very O
different O

My O
husband O
said O
ok O
since O
i O
wanna O
try O

so O
, O
in O
conclusion O
, O
i've O
decided O
never O
to O
return O
to O
this O
place O
, O
unless O
my O
friends O
& O
i O
decide O
to O
be O
cheeky O
one O
fine O
day O
and O
go O
over O
just O
to O
give O
the O

a O
hard O

I O
have O
been O
eating O
at O
this O
restaurant O
since O
young O
and O
my O
family O
love O
it O
alot O
for O
it O
freshness O
of O
the O
food O
, O
price O
and O
also O
the O
ambience O

:) O

The O
ambient O

are O
great O

the O

Honey B

Siew I
; O
yet O
another O
signature O
creation O
which O
vastly O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
, O
my O
Aunt O
had O
commented O
that O
the O
Pork O
Char O
Siew O
was O
as O
brilliant O
as O
those O
in O
Hong O
Kong O
. O

I O
especially O
liked O
the O
Teochew B
dumplings I
, O
which O
were O
pork O
with O
water O
chestnut--something O
I've O
never O
seen O
before O
. O

Service O
is O
average O
. O

A O
must-try O
for O
this O
shop O
is O
the O
Fried B
prawn I
roll I
though O
. O

son O
daid O
egg B
tart I
was O
tastelesd O

You O
may O
like O
it O
. O

Makes O
it O
worth O
our O
trip O
down O
despite O
not O
getting O
any O
custard B
bun I
! O

Now O
, O
the O
siew O
mai O
has O
a O
porky O
smell O
( O
which O
is O
a O
big O
nono O
) O
, O
the O
har B
gao I
skin O
was O
too O
chewy O
and O
sticky O
because O
they O
used O
too O
much O
tapioca O
flour O
, O
that O
shouldnt O
be O
the O
way O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
with O
wasabi O
looks O
and O
tastes O
interesting O
, O
but O
I O
can O
hardly O
detect O
any O
wasabi O
or O
horseradish O
in O
it O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
about O
this O
place O
is O
it O
opens O
during O
the O
wee O
hours O
and O
satisfies O
my O
midnight O
dim O
sum O
cravings O
! O

They O
do O
have O
other O
chinese O
dishes O
on O
the O
menu O
, O
which O
i O
hope O
to O
try O
next O
time O
! O

The O
serving O
style O
is O
very O
traditional O
whereby O
the O
waitress O
will O
push O
the O
carts O
and O
if O
you O
want O
to O
order O
anything O
, O
you O
just O
give O
her O
your O
' O
table O
card O
' O
to O
chop O
, O
then O
collect O
your O
food O
back O
to O
your O
table O
. O

This O
place O
serves O
the O
traditional O
tim O
sums O
that O
have O
been O
an O
all-time O
favourite O
. O

Best O
thing O
about O
the O
siew B
mai I
was O
that O
it O
doesn't O
have O
the O
strong O
pork O
taste O
which O
I O
dreaded O
. O

We O
reached O
there O
1 O
hour O
before O
the O
operating O
of O
the O
restaurant O
so O
we O
thought O
of O
going O
somewhere O
first O
before O
we O
came O
back O
to O
the O
restaurant O
. O

The O
noodles O
colour O
looks O
bit O
off O
but O
tastes O
ok O
. O

Egg B

were O
good O
. O

Order O

Wasn't O
too O
crowded O

Have O
been O
to O
this O
stall O
twice O
and O
i O
love O
their O
dimsums O
. O

There O
were O
certainly O
some O
hits O
and O
misses O
but O
in O
overall O
, O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
is O
for O
sure O
one O
of O
the O
better O
places O
to O
go O
to O
when O
you O
have O
a O
craving O
for O
dim O
sum O
to O
satisfy O
. O

the O
place O
to O
eat O
is O
quite O
cramp O
, O
which O
is O
really O
like O
those O
eat-and-go O
eatery O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
rare O
dimsum O
stall O
that O
operates O
till O
the O
wee O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
good O
place O
for O
dimsum O
and O
chitchat O
for O
night O
owls O
. O

There O
was O
no O
service O
charge O
included O
but O
i O
don't O
feel O
any O
different O
in O
attitude O
because O
of O
that O
fact O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
, O
seriously O
speaking O
, O
is O
not O

A O
great O
afternoon O
meal O
with O
the O
girls O
on O
a O
delicate O
diet O
of O
dim O

is O
the O
perfect O
way O
to O
bond O
. O

Total O
Bill O
is O

I O
decided O
to O
order O
2 O
xiao B
long I
bao I
and O
it O
was O
a O
big O
mistake O
! O

The O
char B
siew I
bao I
is O
nice O
, O
but O
only O
if O
you O
eat O
it O
there O
fresh O
, O
we O
bring O
back O
some O
and O
it O
taste O
stale O
after O
a O
few O
hours O
. O

Ample O
parking O
space O
, O
service O
was O
acceptable O
and O
front O
outdoor O
seating O
area O
closes O
after O
2am O
i O
think O
. O

We O
finally O
squeezed O
into O
a O
table O
( O
by O
ourselves O
) O
at O
the O
corner O
, O
with O
all O
the O
food O
remnants O
, O
plates O
and O
glasses O
from O
the O
previous O
customer O
still O
piled O
high O
on O
the O
table O
. O

The O
food O
wasnt O
at O
all O
fantastic O
and O
the O
tea O
was O
really O
like O
drain O
water O
i O
m O
drinking O
. O

But O
try O
not O
to O
sit O
near O
the O
end O
as O
that's O
where O
the O
rubbish O
truck O
will O
park O
to O
collect O
the O
smelly O
rubbish O
! O

if O
this O
gets O
one O

then O
crystal O

should O
get O
two O
, O
and O
imperial O
treasure O
congee O
and O

three O
. O

( O
Ps O
. O
There O
is O
a O
slightly O
carthatic O
ending O
to O
this O
though O
. O

I O
cannot O
exactly O
recall O
what O
they O
were O
, O
think O
the O
$ O
78 O
version O
includes O
some O
oysters O
and O
the O
$ O
98 O
version O
includes O
abalone O
, O
oysters O
and O
such O
. O

The O
cravings O
for O
dim O
sum O
meant O
that O
i O
am O
always O
on O
the O
lookout O
for O
places O
be O
it O
restaurants O
or O
eateries O
which O
can O
answer O
to O
my O
stomach O
s O
calling O
. O

The O
sauce O
wasn't O
too O
think O
nor O
too O
soupy O
. O

Their O
service O
was O
first-class O
, O
with O
a O
waitress O
who O
never O
failed O
to O
say O
' O
certainly O
' O
for O
every O
request O
we O
had O
. O

I'm O
rating O
them O
down O
because O
of O
my O
experience O
, O
and O
I O
do O
feel O
that O
they O
are O
not O
worth O
all O
the O
rave O
. O

Avoid O
unless O
its O
the O
zombie O
apocalypse O
and O
you O
die O

need O
to O
eat O
something O

Overall O
extremely O
satisfied O
with O
the O
food O
there O
, O
espcially O
that O
of O
their O

which O
are O

But O
of O
course O
, O
it O
s O
really O
just O
about O
personal O
preferences O
. O

2 O
mins O
after O
handing O
them O
our O
order O
, O
drinks O
were O
served O
within O
the O
next O
min O

There O
is O
no O

was O
indeed O
crispy O

nicely O

was O
the O

( O

) O
, O
a O
buttery O
, O
fluffy O
pastry O
filled O
with O

red O
pork O
minced O
meat O
. O

Melt O

the O
mouth O

, O
especially O
when O
eaten O
with O
the O
restaurant's O
sweet O
chili O

. O

went O
to O
this O
place O
for O
some O
late O
dinner O

The O
first O
dim O

we O
had O
was O
the O
Steamed B

( O

. O

You O
can O
even O
taste O

And O
total O
is O
about O
$ O

Priced O
at O
$ O
48 O
+ O
+ O
, O
and O
now O
armed O
with O
the O
knowledge O
of O
what's O
good O
, O
I O
won't O
hesitate O
in O
recommending O
Cherry O
Garden's O
Dim O
Sum O
brunch O
to O
anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
classy O
yet O
reasonably O
priced O
good O
dim O
sum O
meal O
. O

Even O
at O
7pm O
, O
the O
place O
was O
bustling O
with O
life O
. O

We O
arrived O
at O
1035am O
on O
a O
Saturday O
morning O
and O
it O
wasn't O
too O
crowded O
then O
but O
the O
queue O
started O
forming O
quite O
quickly O
from O
11am O
onwards O
- O
so O
do O
go O
early O
if O
you O
want O
to O
avoid O
the O
long O
queue O
. O

Despite O
the O
simplicity O
, O
it O
was O
well O
executed O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
is O
pretty O
standard O
over O
here O
and O
there O
are O
hits O
and O
misses O
. O

You O
can't O
really O
taste O
the O
the O
scallops O
and O
the O
sausage O
. O

To O
be O
really O
honest O
i O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
ever O
since O
god O
knows O
when O
but O
always O
after O
some O
late O
night O
drinking O
so O
as O
a O
disclaimer O
lets O
just O
say O
i O
have O
never O
had O
this O
place O
without O
being O
intoxicated O
before O
! O

The O
exterior O
is O
a O
sweet O
, O
crumbly O
dome O
. O

I O
feel O
like O
I'm O
in O
Dan O
Tart O
heaven O
everytime O
I O
have O
it O
lah O
... O

The O
place O
was O
just O
suddenly O
filled O
up O
within O
minutes O
! O

Very O
proud O
of O
you O
, O
TH O
! O

Tasty O
and O
savoury O
. O

Most O
fats O
were O
removed O
from O
the O
chicken O
. O

Oh O
my O
, O
so O
beautiful O
, O
was O
this O
meant O
to O
be O
eaten O
? O

The O
restaurant O
is O
huge O
and O
sort O
of O
transforms O
you O
back O
to O
the O
80s O
. O

Ambience O
? O

I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
. O

Very O
fragrant O
though O
and O
i O
would O
rate O
it O
as O
slightly O
above O
average O
. O

But O
I O
find O
this O
dish O
so-so O
only O
. O

That's O
all O
I O
can O
remember O
> O
. O

It O
was O
certainly O
a O
delight O
to O
the O
taste O
bud O
to O
feel O
the O
sharp O
contrast O
between O
the O
crisp O
and O
the O
moist O
between O
each O
mouthful O
. O

It O
is O
something O
you O
want O
to O
eat O
again O
and O
again O
. O

I O
personally O
found O
the O
Chilled B
Water I
Melon I
with I
Scallop I
in I
Garlic I
- I
Chilli I
Citrus I
Jus I
the O
most O
delectable O
. O

Next O
, O
the O
mini O
pieces O
of O
Pork B
Ribs I
- O
softly O
cooked O
in O
a O
sumptuous O
gravy O
. O

However O
, O
it O
became O
too O
sweet O
to O
endure O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
custard O
and O
salted O
egg O
yolk O
is O
awesome O
! O

Good O
thing O
though O
is O
that O
once O
you O
are O
in O
, O
service O
is O
prompt O
and O
food O
is O
served O
quite O
fast O
+ O
the O
food O
is O
rewarding O
. O

Visited O
yesterday O
. O

erm O
... O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan's O
fare O
is O
decent O
enough O
but O
not O
so O
much O
to O
get O
me O
into O
the O
queue O
for O
a O
second O
round O

Did O
I O

the O

I O

it O
was O

when O
we O
reach O

This O

did O

couple O
of O
months O
back O
, O
my O
family O
visited O

for O

( O

. O

The O
fresh O
prawns O
go O
easy O
on O
the O
palates O
and O
always O
welcome O
with O
second O
helpings O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
to O
say O
the O
service O
have O
since O
changed O
and O
they O
are O
friendly O
and O
actually O
makes O
me O
feel O
welcome O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
a O
little O
over O
deep O
fried O
but O
nonetheless O
, O
crispy O
and O
again O
, O
since O
it's O
prawn O
, O
good O
. O

nice O
frying O
skills O
here O
.. O

Make O
sure O
you O
have O
all O
people O
present O
before O
they O
let O
you O
in O
. O

But O
after O
I O
have O
tried O
it O
today O
, O
I O
am O
very O
disappointed O
. O

One O
sad O
thing O
is O
that O
they O
limit O
one O
person O
to O
3 O
buns O
( O
1 O
plate O
) O
. O

Same O
price O
but O
it's O
way O
better O
there O
. O

It O
can O
be O
wet O
but O
not O
with O
chilli O
sauce O
and O
food O
stained O
on O
the O
plates O
and O
utensils O
. O

I O
like O
! O

The O
restaurant O
plies O
you O
with O
a O
wide O
assortment O
of O
gingerly-crafted O
Cantonese O
dim O
sum O
amidst O
a O
repertoire O
of O
soups O
, O
staples O
, O
seafood O
, O
meats O
and O
desserts O
. O

So O
if O
you O
want O
to O
avoid O
the O
queue O
, O
go O
there O
before O
ten O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

There O
was O
the O
accompany O
of O
the O
green O
, O
hot O
wasabi O
! O

I O
feel O
that O
all O
the O
bosses O
care O
about O
is O
their O
dollars O
and O
cents O
- O
- O
all O
they O
do O
is O
punch O
madly O
at O
the O
cash O
register O
to O
ring O
up O
their O
profits O
. O

I O
will O
always O
have O
cravings O
for O
the O
and O
the O
lamien B
in I
fried I
onion I
oil I
and O
would O
drag O
friends O
there O
to O
have O
it O
. O

Why O
don O
t O
we O
turn O
it O
upside O
down O
? O

We O
also O
ordered O
the O
suckling B

you'll O
be O

The O

the O

very O
generous O

If O
you O

just O
admit O

it O
back O

Though O
the O

( O

i O
ordered O

the O

But O
for O
the O

the O

After O
the O
meal O
, O
we O
ordered O
the O
black B
sesame I
dessert I
, O
as O
well O
as O
Gui B
Lin I
Gao I
. O

To O
me O
, O
a O
few O
dishes O
stand O
out O
. O

The O
soft O
, O
malleable O
rice O
and O
generous O
filings O
aside O
, O
this O
large O
lotus-leaf O
wrapped O
dumpling O
had O
a O
HUGE O
whole O
salted O
egg O
yolk O
inside O
! O

But O
still O
I O
wanted O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

There's O
no O
real O
need O
to O
rush O
to O
visit O
! O

Not O
cheap O
, O
definitely O
not O
an O
atas O
dining O
place O
and O
absolutely O
not O
for O
those O
who O
wants O
king's O
service O
... O

The O
rice O
roll O
is O
smooth O
, O
and O
texture O
so O
soft O
. O

The O
prawns O
are O
fresh O
though O
, O
which O
made O
the O
dish O
more O
than O
just O
being O
decent O
. O

Of O
the O
dim O
sum O
that O
we O
ordered O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
glutinous B
rice I
, O
the O
pan B
fried I
cheong I
fun I
, O
the O
fried B
Xian I
Zhu I
Juan I

their O
iconic O
Golden B

Yummyyy O
, O
authentic O
HK B
Milk I

. O

The O
combination O
of O
this O
bun O
is O
just O
perfect O
! O

we'd O
to O
queue O
for O
about O
30-40 O
mins O
when O
we O
went O
there O
on O
a O
sat O
afternoon O
. O

We O
did O
not O

We O
ordered O
quite O
of O
number O
of O
items O
... O

service O
is O
pretty O
good O
, O
they O
clear O
the O
dishes O
fast O
and O
fresh O
food O
comes O
out O
of O
the O
kitchen O
fast O
too O
! O

At O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
, O
i O
did O
not O
get O
to O
eat O
all O
the O
items O
i O
wanted O
to O
. O

Definitely O
the O
frozen O
variety O
. O

There O
is O
no O
indication O
where O
the O
queue O
is O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
coming O
back O
again O
! O

It's O
more O
spicy O
than O
sour O
with O
chilli O
padi O
in O
it O
. O

A O
must-have O
if O
you O
ever O
drop O
by O
the O
kitchen O

The O
environment O
is O
obviously O
vibrant O
( O

case O
you O
don't O

4 O

delicious O
. O

3 O
diners O
, O
3 O
differing O
opinions O
. O

I O
found O
it O
quite O
disgusting O
. O

I O
like O
the O
quaint O
dining O
atmosphere O
of O
Red O
Star O
as O
gives O
me O
the O
old O
Hong O
Kong O
vibe O
, O
especially O
when O
you O
can O
still O
see O
Dim O
Sum O
push O
carts O
around O
which O
is O
a O
rare O
sight O
in O
Singapore O
nowadays O
. O

I O
went O
there O
during O
lunch O
hours O
, O
it O
was O
rather O
fast O
because O
we O
waited O
for O
like O
couple O
of O
mins O
. O

Pricing O
was O
also O
a O
little O
steep O
, O
wasted O
over O
an O
hour O
here O
. O

The O
soup O
is O
fairly O
tasty O
and O
the O
skin O
is O
thin O
. O

it O
was O
pretty O
frustrating O
to O
see O
other O
tables O
slowly O
filling O
up O
with O
food O
while O
our O
table O
remained O
empty O
. O

When O
the O
bill O
arrived O
they O
had O
kindly O
taken O
off O
my O
dish O
and O
made O
us O
pay O
only O
for O
what O
we O
ate O
. O

The O
last O
time O
i O
went O
to O
Red O
Star O
was O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
, O
and O
then O
didn O
t O
have O
much O
pictures O
to O
show O
of O
due O
to O
the O
poor O
lighting O
. O

Skin O
is O
thin O
and O
prawns O
are O
juicy O
. O

, O
having O

that O
, O
I O
was O
hopeful O
that O
Cherry O

could O
/ O
would O
spring O
a O
few O
surprises O
. O

A O
little O
sticky O
as O
you O
expect O
in O
glutinous O
rice O
. O

Maybe O
due O
to O
crowd O
, O
she O
tends O
to O
be O
a O
bit O
vexed O
... O

The O
only O
2 O
dishes O
worth O
mentioning O
are O
the O
carrot B
cake I
and O
the O
golden B

go O
in O
the O
weekday O
afternoons O
, O
it O
is O
not O
that O
crowded O
. O

Pouring O
through O
pages O
and O
pages O
of O
the O
bill O
of O
fare O
gave O
me O
a O
mind O
boggling O
migraine O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
visiting O
Red O
Star O
, O
really O
... O
no O
car O
dunno O
how O
to O
reach O
. O

Hee O
hee O
don't O
even O
know O
how O
much O
each O
plate O
costs O
, O
just O
eat O
and O
pay O
lah O
! O

Restaurant O
pricing O
but O
worse O
than O
coffee O
shop O
taste O
. O

I O
have O
never O
sat O
inside O
for O
fear O
of O
food O
smell O
which O
I O
cannot O
over O
come O

Thousand B
layer I
cakes I
( O
I O
literally O
translated O
this O
from O
mandarin O
) O
This O
dish O
consists O
of O
pork O
floss O
and O
cucumber O
. O

I O
tried O
to O
ask O
other O
waitresses O
to O
see O
what O
the O
response O
was O
and O
everyone O
was O
just O
as O
rude O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
excited O
as O
we O
were O
at O
the O
prospect O
of O
good O
, O
cheap O
and O
authentic O
dim O
sum O
, O
the O
queue O
was O
already O
very O
long O
at O
10am O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Finally O
we O
ordered O
the O
dessert O
. O

by O

the O

I O

Its O
about O
one O

They O

the O
traditional O

The O
breakfast-brunch-lunch O

into O
one O
such O
that O
there O
is O
an O
ever-present O

The O
restaurant O
presents O
a O
setting O
of O
a O
traditional O
dim O

eatery O
with O

. O

Definitely O
one O
of O
the O
best O
versions O
i O
have O
tried O

And O
I O
, O
of O
course O
, O
am O
the O
melancholic O
central O
female O

who O
spends O
most O
of O
her O

meting O
out O

stopping O
by O
the O

Ambience O
wise O
- O
enough O
said O

And O
the O
custard O
in O
this O
bun O
is O
sweet O
, O
creamy O
and O
so O
smooth O
oh O
so O
delicious O
now O
I O
think O
of O
it O
I O
want O
to O
weep O
already O
lar O
for O
not O
ordering O
another O
basket O
for O
myself O
! O

Price O
quite O
reasonable O
i O
guess O
, O
each O
plate O
of O
dim-sum O
is O
about O
$ O
2.80 O
. O

Handmade O
by O
the O

And O
with O

I O
finally O
gave O
up O
and O
rang O
the O

up O

We O
realized O
too O
late O
and O
were O
charged O
for O
the O
extra O
cup O
. O

They O
also O
forget O
one O
of O
our O
orders O
until O
we O
reminded O
them O
. O

and O
when O
we O
turned O
back O
to O
the O
menu O
, O
she O
continued O
having O
a O
bloody O
loud O
conversation O
with O
another O

I O

much O
that O
I O
keep O
trying O

I O

very O
tender O

because O
it O

a O
rich O

This O
huge O

is O
indeed O
hidden O
in O
a O
classic O
HDB O

in O
the O
heart O
of O

For O
the O

I O
rather O
go O

. O

I O
love O
this O
dish O
! O

Siu B

a O
little O
undercook O
but O
still O
alright O

still O
alive O

( O
Apparently O
the O
main O
chef O
adjusted O
their O
recipe O
according O
to O
Singaporeans O
preferences O
, O
failed O
on O
me O
though O
. O

Not O
so O
keen O
on O
this O
version O
of O
the O
custard B
bun I
. O

Still O
quite O
an O
interesting O
place O
to O
have O
dim O
sum O
at O
though O
. O

There O
were O
also O
a O
few O
items O
which O
I O
am O
still O
undecided O
on O
, O
but O
you O
could O
try O
if O
you O
have O
excess O
stomach O
room O
or O
are O
sick O
of O
the O
above O

There O
were O
a O
good O
mix O
of O
radish O
, O
dried O
shrimps O
and O
chinese O
sauages O
in O
it O
. O

The O
menu O
had O
a O
tagline O
which O
read O
: O
We O
serve O
the O
best O
foods O
, O
but O
not O
fast O
foods O
. O

The O
lady O
who O
handled O
cash O
, O
also O
ran O
the O
food O
orders O
and O
had O
her O
thumb O
in O
the O
food O
while O
handing O
out O
the O
plate O
and O
I O
found O
a O
5cm O
strand O
of O
hair O
in O
my O
cheong O
fun O
skin O
, O
guess O
it O
got O
in O
during O
the O
steaming O
. O

We O
placed O
our O
orders O
and O
the O
food O
came O
pretty O
fast O

I O

more O
than O
a O

and O
recently O
we O
went O
there O
again O

still O
find O

many O

criticising O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O

! O

The O
only O
one O
available O
was O
a O
watery O

which O
definitely O
did O
not O
go O
down O
well O
with O
the O

for O

The O
star O

the O

But O
the O

introduced O

I O
think O
there O
was O
a O
special O
chinese O

, O
full O
of O

we O

were O

to O
a O

was O
unable O
to O
produce O

needed O

a O

of O
mine O

in O
the O

something O

I O
found O
myself O
in O
one O
of O

on O
the O

selling O
man O
. O
and O
that's O
even O
before O
we O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
look O
at O
the O
menu O
. O
and O
boy O
will O
u O
be O
amazed O
by O
the O
menu O
. O

The O
service O
was O
really O
horrible O
and O
had O
given O
us O
a O
really O
bad O
experience O
. O

If O
you O
have O
never O
been O
here O
, O
time O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

The O
service O
was O
fast O
and O
there O
wasn't O
as O
long O
a O
queue O
as O
there O
was O
when O
THW O
first O
opened O
so O
we O
got O
into O
the O
restaurant O
in O
less O
than O
half O
an O
hour O
during O
weekend O
lunch O
time O
. O

If O
you're O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
pig's O
liver O
, O
you O
can O
try O
the O
Vermicelli B
Roll I
with I
BBQ I
Pork I
( O
$ O
5.50 O
) O
instead O
. O

It O
was O
approxomately O
25 O
- O
min O
wait O
. O

The O
Scallop B
, I
Sausage I
Carrot I
Cake I
with I
XO I
sauce I
XO O
$ O

is O
the O
first O
one O
that O
I O
will O
rave O
about O
. O

We O
were O
looking O
for O
late O
tea O
time O
snacks O
after O
I O
went O
back O
to O
my O
office O
around O
that O
area O
, O
and O
we O
have O
not O
patronized O
Victor O
s O
Kitchen O
for O
a O
while O
, O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
head O
here O
. O

I O
would O
rather O
go O
to O
a O
hawker O
for O
dim O
sum O
. O

Since O
we O
d O
tried O
only O
a O
fraction O
of O
the O
menu O
, O
we O
wouldn O
t O
mind O
returning O
for O
the O
rest O
. O

That's O
right O
. O

The O
black O
sauce O
was O
not O
too O
salty O
or O
sweet O
and O
it O
complemented O
the O
bland O
taste O
of O
the O
chee B
cheong I
fun I
well O
. O

All O
things O
that O
we O
order O
, O
even O
the O
must O
try O
that O
has O
been O
reviewed O
in O
many O
media O
that O
they O
put O
on O
the O
wall O
, O
I O
ever O
bought O
that O
at O
hawker O
centers O
and O
didn't O
found O
it O
taste O
any O
different O
. O

Her O
response O
was O
, O
la O
. O
and O
a O
shrug O
. O

> O
Note O

: O
They O
don O
t O
take O
reservations O
. O

When O
i O
said O
i O
wanted O
tim O
sum O
for O
dinner O
, O
my O
boyfren O
exclaimed O
but O
tt's O
for O
lunch O
! O

Overall O
, O
not O
an O
ideal O
song O
choice O
for O
the O
restaurant O
and O
stay O
away O
if O
you O
are O
in O
celebratory O
mood O
. O

Must O
try O
to O
avoid O
this O
place O

It O
was O
served O
slightly O
warmed O
but O
not O
piping O
hot O
, O
as O
the O
paste O
had O
been O
stored O
in O
a O
tumbler O
prior O
to O
serving O
. O

Maybe O
partly O
we O
have O
ourselves O
to O
blame O
I O
left O
it O
out O
there O
for O
pretty O
long O
before O
consuming O
it O
. O

We O
would O
have O
preferred O
it O
if O
the O
Chicken O
was O
better O
seasoned O
with O
the O
Chinese O
wine O
since O
the O
slight O
hint O
of O
alcohol O
did O
not O
really O
coincide O
with O
the O
concept O
of O
Drunken O
Chicken O
. O

And O
there O
you O
go O
! O

Victor's O
Kitchen O
might O
be O
a O
gem O
hidden O
in O
Sunshine O
Plaza O
at O
Bencoolen O
St O
, O
at O
least O
not O
so O
much O
hidden O
from O
dim O
sum O
fans O
and O
old O
timers O
. O

Also O
a O
tad O
greasy O
for O
me O
. O

When O
is O
the O
last O
time O
you O
queued O
for O
dim O
sum O
in O
Singapore O
? O

Not O
salty O
at O
all O
and O
can O
be O
taken O
on O
its O
own O
without O
rice O
( O
50 O
cents O
for O
a O
regular O
size O
and O
30 O
cents O
for O
a O
small O
one O
) O
. O

On O
the O
whole O
, O
the O
food O
was O
great O
! O

Let O
us O
find O
out O
if O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
has O
the O
perfect O
ooze O
factor O
indeed O
! O

Wanted O
to O
take O
away O
because O
we're O
in O
a O
rush O
, O
instead O
, O
we O
were O
reprimanded O
for O
not O
being O
understanding O
along O
with O
an O
unnecessary O
condescending O
tone O
. O

The O
food O
may O
fall O
short O
of O
glamorous O
compared O
to O
other O
popular O
Dim O
Sum O
restaurants O

Kudos O
to O
them O
. O

Went O
there O
last O
Sunday O
, O
last O
minute O
decision O
and O
reached O
there O
around O
1.30 O
pm O
and O
there O
was O
still O
a O
q O
for O
it O
. O

One O
drawback O
is O
that O
it O
may O
take O
some O
time O
for O
the O
auntie O
to O
reach O
your O
table O
. O

The O
skin O
was O
fluffy O
and O
light O
and O
strong O
enough O
to O
withstand O
the O
grip O
of O
the O
chopsticks O
yet O
delicate O
enough O
to O
break O
open O
with O
just O
a O
little O
more O
pressure O
enforced O
. O

Dim O
Sum O
were O
decent O
. O

I O
was O
not O
fast O
enough O
in O
taking O
a O
photo O
of O
the O
Phoneix B
Porridge I
. O

However O
, O
this O
bowl O
was O
served O
cold O
( O
my O
pet O
peeve O
) O
so O
I O
was O
rather O
disappointed O
. O

my O
only O
grouse O
: O
it O
is O
a O
tad O
expensive O
. O

Beancurd B
skin I
roll I
was O
too O
oily O
. O

you O
know O
.. O

thought O
it O
was O
not O
cooked O
enough O
... O

Bro O
and O
me O
actually O
think O
that O
it O
tasted O
not O
bad O
. O

with O
hot O
juices O
oozing O
out O
when O
you O
sink O
your O
teeth O
into O
it O
. O

Our O
family O
are O
not O
picky O
on O
food O
but O
, O
the O
food O
is O
not O
as O
nice O
as O
what O
some O
had O
reviewed O
. O

The O
restaurant O
takes O
up O
3 O
shop O
houses O
and O
another O
one O
is O
for O
take O
out O
. O

I O
checked O
with O
Swee O
Choon O
staffs O
whether O
need O
to O
queue O
before O
going O
in O
. O

I O
had O
my O
exepctations O
at O
the O
right O
place O
before O
I O
walked O
in O
so O
everything O
is O
ok O
. O

e O
brinjals B

were O
a O
slight O
tasteless O
initially O
but O
after O
e O
mostly O

g O
those O
steamy O

food O
/ O

will O
not O
be O
placed O
near O
children O
Ambience O
... O

I O
brought O
my O
mother O
there O
with O
my O
family O
and O
we O
had O
a O
table O
of O
8 O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
said O
one O
is O
reading O
a O
menu O
in O
front O
of O
the O
restaurant O
, O
the O
staff O
still O
insisted O
that O
everybody O
has O
to O
be O
in O
this O
line O
in O
order O
to O
be O
given O
a O
table O
. O

I O
like O
to O
sit O
in O
the O
back O
alley O
as O
compared O
to O
the O
air-con O
seating O
inside O
the O
shop O
, O
it's O
just O
that O
little O
bit O
more O
fun O
and O
filled O
with O
character O
. O

But O
in O
terms O
of O
taste O
.. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
Watermelon B
Chutney I
with I
Aloe I
Vera I
, I
Crystal I
Pears I
and I
Refreshing I
Lemongrass I
Jelly I
was O
yet O
another O
perculiar O
dessert O
which O
I O
did O
not O
really O
enjoy O
, O
I O
could O
not O
really O
distinguish O
any O
sweet O
relish O
of O
the O
dessert O
while O
it O
was O
quite O
bland O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O

what O
more O
having O
it O
fresh O
? O
! O
: O
O O
oh O
yeah O
, O
i O
forgot O
to O
mention O
that O
i O
came O
here O
at O
around O
9.40 O
am O
in O
the O
morning O
( O
when O
it O
opens O
at O
10am O
) O
just O
so O
that O
we O
don't O
have O
to O
be O
delayed O
in O
the O
queue O
. O

Couldn't O
quite O
make O
out O
any O
distinctive O
cod O
fish O
taste O
though O
. O

We O
simply O
love O
how O
the O
rich O
creamy O
egg O
custard O
blended O
perfectly O
with O
the O
salted O
egg O
yolk O
- O
sweet O
with O
a O
slight O
tinge O
of O
saltiness O
. O

But O
omg O
... O
I'm O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
will O
visit O
again O
should O
spitton O
is O
still O
available O
. O

Especially O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
right O
at O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
kitchen O
. O

Ingeniously O
served O
separately O
in O
a O
bed O
of O
ice O
to O
prevent O
dilution O
. O

( O
- O
) O
Broken O
, O
loose O
and O
pathetic O
amount O
of O
chicken O
pieces O
, O
it O
was O
mostly O
rice O
. O

It O
was O
amazing O
how O
fast O
the O
dishes O
started O
flowing O
in O
( O
non-stop O
) O
so O
much O
that O
all O
of O
us O
were O
at O
a O
lost O
which O
to O
dig O
in O
first O
, O
which O
is O
a O
good O
sign O
. O

It O
was O
excellently O
awesome O
. O

Pork B
Dumpling I
with I
Shrimp I
( O
$ O
5.00 O
) O
. O

There O
were O
seats O
in O
the O
back O
alley O
too O
. O

It O
was O
prawny O
, O
with O
a O
nice O
bite O
- O
but O
crabby O
( O
no O
pun O
intended O
) O
it O
was O
not O
, O
well O
who O
cares O
? O

The O
dessert O
was O
served O
on O
a O
bowl O
of O
dry O
ice O
which O
looked O
so O
pretty O
. O

Now O
, O
it O
s O
all O
in O
a O
little O
button O
. O

It O
is O
actually O
quite O
good O
. O

I O
had O
the O

the O

, O
the O
kurobuta B
pork I

siew I
buns I
, O
the O
carrot B
cake I
and O
the O
Hashima B
for O
dessert O
. O

The O
Beef B
Tenderloin I
was O
probably O
the O
highlight O
of O
the O
night O
. O

It O
wasn't O
strong O
and O
I O
liked O
the O
combination O
. O

Bags O
go O
on O
your O
laps O

Why O
are O
we O
paying O
restaurant O
prices O
, O
when O
we O
have O
to O
serve O
ourselves O
, O
and O
eat O
food O
that's O
of O
foodcourt O
standards O
? O

My O
friend O
likes O
the O
egg B
tarts I
very O
much O
... O

He O
liked O
it O
but O
i O
didn't O
find O
it O
very O
special O
. O

The O
salt O
and O
pepper O
that O
was O
coated O
outside O
brought O
the O
whole O
simple O
porkrib O
dish O
to O
a O
whole O
new O
level O
. O

And O
when O
we O
reminded O
them O
again O
, O
they O
gave O
us O
a O
attitude O
look O
or O
reponse O
and O
the O
worst O
a O
irate O
wait O
hand-sign O
... O

Hey O

you O
can't O

Chin O

i O
went O
there O
last O
sunday O
afternoon O
w O
/ O
a O
group O
of O
12 O
( O
that O
makes O
it O
a O
total O
of O
13 O
people O
incl O
. O
me O
) O
for O
lunch O
at O
around O
11 O
or O
12 O
? O

family O
and O
I O
went O
to O
Red O
Star O
Restaurant O
because O
the O
dad O
had O
been O
wanting O
to O
try O
out O
this O
dim O
sum O
restaurant O
. O

The O
orange O
juice O
was O
also O
too O
watered O
down O
. O

The O
redeeming O
items O
were O
the O
foo B
pei I
rolls I
- O
another O
of O
my O
top O
favourites O
- O
and O
the O
mango B
sago I
with I
pomelo I
. O

This O
place O
started O
small O
, O
and O
cosy O
, O
I O
can O
still O
remember O
what O
Victor O
has O
said O
about O
why O
he O
started O
this O
business O
in O
Singapore O
before O
( O
in O
cantonese O
): O
I O
tried O
the O
dim O
sum O
here O
in O
Singapore O
and O
they O
are O
really O
not O
up O
to O
standard O
, O
I O
came O
here O
to O
show O
Singaporeans O
what O
is O
real O
dim O
sum O
And O
he O
means O
it O
, O
the O
food O
was O
really O
good O
. O

The O
tea O
served O
for O
that O
day O
was O
Dragon O
Well O
( O
Long O
Jing O
) O
It O
has O
an O
initial O
slight O
bitter O
taste O
but O
aromatic O
aftertaste O
. O

! O

I'm O
quite O
particular O
about O
this O
. O

For O
the O
price O
I O
was O
paying O
, O
I O
was O
blown O
away O
by O
the O
sheer O
number O
of O
quality O
items O
they O
served O
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
to O
Mandarin O
Oriental O
hotel O
before O
so O
i O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
by O
the O
simple O
yet O
posh O
decor O
that O
greeted O
me O
the O
moment O
i O
stepped O
into O
the O
hotel O
. O

oven B
baked I
boneless I
spring I
chicken I
in I
barbecue I
garlic I
sauce I
this O
dish O
puzzled O
me O
for O
a O
few O
reasons O
. O

To O
their O
credit O
, O
they O
DO O
push O
it O
to O
the O
tables O
away O
from O
the O
main O
aisle O
. O

I O
was O
like O
wow O
when O
I O
took O
my O
first O
bite O
. O

Delicious O
thirst O
quencher O
, O
but O
otherwise O
nothing O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
. O

I O
adore O
it O
! O

Overall O
, O
the O
food O
was O
okay O
, O
but O
i O
think O
crystal O
jade O
and O
of O
course O
lei O
garden O
and O
other O
places O
has O
better O
dim O
sum O
. O

I've O
been O
to O
Red O
Star O
for O
a O
few O
years O
now O
and O
I O
must O
say O
that O
the O
food O
is O
still O
good O
. O

The O
price O
was O
okay O
because O
there O
wasn't O
GST O
or O
service O
charge O
. O

The O
xo B
carrot I
cake I
tasted O
more O
like O
dried O
shrimp O
carrot O
cake O
than O
xo O
. O

Firstly O
, O
instead O
of O
the O
usual O
fresh O
white O
Radish O
, O
their O
is O
this O
fried O
version O
that O
taste O
like O
bee O
hoon O
. O

To O
me O
, O
nothing O
is O
worth O
the O
hype O
if O
the O
local O
themselves O
do O
event O
visit O

We O
arrived O
at O
about O
8 O

and O
went O
to O
sit O
at O
the O
backlane O
under O
the O
trees O

the O
famous O

wanton O

round O
the O
corner O
and O
discovered O
a O
muffin O
and O
chicken O
pie O
place O
that O
also O
appears O
to O
be O
very O
popular O
. O

This O
is O
my O
2nd O
visit O
after O
more O
than O
4 O
months O
. O

It O
is O
awesome O
. O

It's O
sort O
of O
like O
a O
Japanese O
maki O
, O
rolled O
with O
egg O
, O
meat O
floss O
and O
a O
cucumber O
. O

The O
waitress O

not O
exactly O
very O
clean O
with O

This O
was O
the O
most O
expensive O
dish O
we O
ordered O
this O
round O
. O

I O
also O
liked O
the O
crunchiness O
of O
cubed O

that O
added O
texture O
and O
taste O
to O
the O

Excellent O

the O
staff O
is O
warm O

attentive O

were O
very O
patient O
with O

The O

The O

is O
not O
spectacular O
even O
for O
an O

like O
Red O

, O
I O
expected O
more O
from O
them O
. O

I O
absolutely O
love O
this O
dish O
! O

But O
a O
good O
thing O
about O
their O
order-card O
is O
that O
the O

names O
were O
spelled O
out O

If O
you O
are O

who O
doesn O

more O

Yes O
I O
loving O
it O
so O
much O
that O
I O
am O
giving O
it O
5 O
out O
of O
5 O
, O
first O
time O
since O
I O
started O
this O
blog O
. O

For O
one O
, O
the O
queue O
wasn't O
that O
long O
. O

The O
taste O
is O
just O
very O
poor O
and O
' O
coarse O
' O
e O
. O
g O
. O

Evidently O
, O
pretty O
much O
everyone O
else O
had O
the O
same O
bright O
idea O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
lived O
literally O
just O
across O
the O
street O
, O
so O
it O
was O
rather O
advantageous O
to O
us O
beating O
the O
crowd O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

It O
didn't O
taste O
too O
bad O
but O
still O

The O

was O

, O
fine O
, O
light O
, O
passable O

Touted O
as O
their O
signature O
dish O
, O
i O
was O
totally O
disappointed O
with O
the O
one O
i O
had O
here O
. O

it's O
not O
out O
of O
e O
world O
but O
it's O
quite O
savoury O
without O
being O
too O
oily O
so O
kudos O
.. O

They O
served O
it O
with O
2 O
interesting O
sides O
of O
preserved O
beans O
. O

One O
thing O
i O
liked O
is O
the O
mango B
sago I
with I
pomelo I
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Swee O
Choon O
a O
number O
of O
times O
over O
the O
years O
and O
i O
don't O
understand O
what O
the O
hype O
is O
all O
about O
. O

My O
first O
time O
trying O
such O
a O
Siew B
Mai I
; O
Vegetable O
and O
Quail O
Egg O

Mai I
. O

A O

somehow O

Singapore O
experience O
. O

The O
choice O
of O
our O
team O
dinner O
was O
Cherry O
Garden O
, O
the O
flagship O
Chinese O
restaurant O
of O
Oriental O
Hotel O
. O

Have O
been O
reading O
about O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
at O
various O
blogs O
and O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

The O
chief O
chef O
hails O
from O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
who O
was O
previously O
a O
chef O
at O
Victoria O
Hotel O
. O

I O
was O
amazed O
when O
we O
paid O
up O
. O

Although O
the O
strands O
of O
radish O
added O
texture O
to O
the O
very O
soft O
carrot O
cake O
underneath O
the O
pan-fried O
layer O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
a O
little O
towards O
the O
bland O
side O
though O
. O

Walking O
into O
the O
restaurant O
, O
you O
half O
expect O
Maggie O
Cheung O
and O
Tony O
Leung O
sitting O
in O
a O
corner O
table O
, O
whispering O
their O
sweet O
, O
incoherent O
Wong-Kar-Wai-film O
nothings O
to O
each O
other O
. O

Checked O
. O

Roast B
duck I
was O
crispy O
but O
otherwise O
very O
dry O
. O

For O
those O
who O
want O
a O
strongly O
flavour O
, O
can O
add O
pepper O
and O
light O
soy O
sauce O
. O

As O
for O
the O
food O
, O
we O
ordered O
the O
Crispy B
Scallop I
to O
start O
- O
was O
fantastic O
. O

better O
go O
during O
off-peak O
, O
but O
early O
as O
the O
yummy O
carrot B
cake I
is O
hot O
! O

First O
off O
, O
their O
most O
famous O
dish O
, O
the O
Baked B
Bun I
with I
BBQ I
Pork I
( O
3 O
pcs O
$ O
4.50 O
) O
which O
made O
Tim O
Ho O
Wa O
famous O
! O

Fresh O
sweet O
prawns O
! O

Manned O
by O
alot O
of O
middle O
aged O
aunties O
and O
uncles O
. O

I O
would O
eat O
a O
truckload O
of O
these O
if O
they O
didn O
t O
come O
with O
calories O
. O

waited O
for O
bout O
45mins O
, O
considering O
that O
the O
queue O
was O
moving O
at O
a O
moderate O
speed O
. O

3 O
of O
us O
ordered O
12 O
dishes O
and O
came O
away O
feeling O
very O
full O
and O
very O
satisfied O
. O

' O
I O
was O
looking O
for O
a O
dim O
sum O
place O
for O
supper O
and O
there O
were O
really O
very O
few O
, O
don't O
know O
if O
this O
has O
something O
to O
do O
with O
staying O
in O
the O
east O
or O
not O
, O
so O
we O
settled O
for O
this O
place O
. O

This O
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
visit O
with O
a O
big O
group O
of O
friends O
& O
family O
, O
especially O
with O
friends O
from O
other O
countries O
. O

were O

and O
soft O
all O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O

it O
! O

Sweet O
taste O
, O
and O
bun O
is O
soft O
, O
and O
fillings O
not O
too O
stigny O
either O
:) O

However O
, O
it O
was O
a O
tad O
too O
sweet O
for O
me O
. O

Victor's O
Kitchen O
was O
a O
pretty O
decent O
experience O
. O

Judging O
from O
the O
amount O
of O
orders O
that O
they O
are O
handling O
we O
were O
impressed O
that O
our O
food O
was O
served O
within O
5 O
mins O
. O

Unlike O
other O
restaurants O
, O
it O
doesn't O
just O
come O
in O
a O
standard O
basket O
of O
3 O
pieces O
which O
is O
a O
awkward O
number O
when O
we O
had O
4 O
people O
. O

If O
you O
are O
going O
there O
, O
try O
this O
dish O
. O

Don O
t O
let O
them O
cheat O
you O
hor O
! O

Has O
been O
a O
while O
I O
visit O
HGW O
for O
recommendations O
, O
but O
I O
am O
not O
the O
kind O
who O
post O
any O
comment O
. O

Simply O
furnished O
, O
it's O
comfortable O
and O
has O
a O
wide O
enough O
area O
for O
the O
queues O
that O
start O
every O
morning O
( O
opened O
10th O
April O
) O
at O
about O
9am O
. O

Placed O
my O
orders O
.. O
food O
came O
only O
45 O
mins O
later O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
and O
the O
food O
is O
nice O
and O
pretty O
to O
see O
. O

Victor O

Kitchen O
s O
Golden B
Egg I
Yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
has O
certainly O
lived O
up O
to O
its O
reputation O
and O
it O
is O
definitely O
a O
must O
- O
try O
! O

the O
attitude O
of O
the O
staffs O
were O
bad O
too O
, O
yet O
in O
the O
bill O
, O
we O
need O
to O
pay O
for O
5 O
% O
service O
charge O
, O
did O
they O
really O
service O
us O
, O
no O
at O
all O
... O
! O
! O
! O

During O
weekends O
, O
you O
will O
almost O
have O
to O
run O
over O
to O
the O
kitchen O
entrance O
and O
pounce O
on O
the O
dim O
sum O
once O
it O
is O
pushed O
out O
else O
you O
might O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
another O
hour O
before O
you O
get O
to O
sink O
your O
teeth O
into O
the O

And O
his O
tone O
, O
his O
tone O
! O

You're O
less O
likely O
to O
sit O
comfortable O
due O
to O
the O
occassional O
back O

with O
the O

I'm O

at O

and O
I've O
written O
a O
review O
dated O

Feb O
' O

. O

However O
the O
skin O
of O
the O
cheong O
fun O
or O
rice O
roll O
is O
rather O
thick O
, O
i O
ll O
prefer O
it O
to O
be O
slightly O
thinner O
. O

Love O
the O
ambience O
here O
. O

The O
spring B
roll I
with I
egg I
white I
is O
really O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
I O
really O
love O
it O
but O
I O
think O
the O
filling O
can O
be O
better O
. O

However O
it's O
way O
too O
salty O
and O
eating O
a O
few O
left O
me O
parched O
. O

Some O
stuff O
like O
porridge O
is O
okay O
, O
healthy O
. O

Read O
: O
It's O
stated O
in O
the O
Business O
Description O
that O
Queues O
are O
long O
, O
but O
there O
is O
an O
SMS O
waiting O
system O
in O
place O
, O
and O
a O
takeaway O
counter O
for O
those O
who O
just O
want O
a O

to O
go O

The O
Combination O
of O
Fresh O
Scallops O
in O
Three O
Flavours O
was O
a O
case O
of O
hits O
and O
misses O
. O

Few O
dishes O
that O
I O
really O
like O
are O
; O
Baby B
abalone I
& I
fresh I
mushroom I
wrapped I
in I
paper I
, O
crispy B
prawn I
with I
wasabi I
& I
fresh I
mango I
, O
kurabuta B
pork I
in I
soya I
wine I
sauce I
, O
homemade B
tofu I
with I
vegetables I
and O
as O
for O
desserts O
, O
cream B
of I
avocado I
and O
cream B
of I
guava I
with I
sour I
plum I
jelly I
. O

I O
will O
definitely O
come O
back O
there O
and O
recommend O
this O
place O
to O
all O
Chinese O
food O
and O
dim O
sum O
lovers O
. O

It O
is O
flavourful O
and O
one O
can O
taste O
the O
carrot O
/ O
radish O
strips O
, O
shrimp O
bits O
[ O
aka O
hey O
bee O
] O
. O

Another O
dish O
that O
we O
loved O
was O
the O
Pork B
Ribs I
in I
Black I
Bean I
Sauce I
( O
$ O
3.00 O
) O
, O
which O
was O
just O
savoury O
with O
the O
sauce O
taking O
in O
the O
flavours O
of O
the O
meat O
as O
though O
simmered O
for O
hours O
. O

Really O
yummy O
! O

Over-steamed O
, O
the O
skin O
fell O
apart O
the O
moment O
we O
picked O
it O
up O
and O
was O
slightly O
on O
the O
thick O
and O
starchy O
side O
. O

Being O
affordable O
shouldn't O
compromise O
on O
quality O
, O
BUT O
... O

Of O
course O
what O
is O
the O
best O
is O
still O
the O
nice O
ladies O
pushing O
the O
carts O
of O
yummies O
! O
! O

Despite O
that O
the O
La B
Mian I
was O
cheap O
, O
it O
tasted O
.. O

Really O
liked O
the O
zhar B
leung I
( O
i O
. O
e O
. O
fried O
doughstick O
in O
rice O
roll O
) O
, O
was O
pretty O
much O
the O
closest O
we've O
had O
to O
Hong O
Kong O
fare O
. O

we O
are O
7pax O
in O
a O
group O
, O
the O
staff O
keep O
us O
waiting O
outside O
and O
need O
to O
wait O
until O
all O
member O
came O
, O
even O
less O
one O
also O
cannot O
go O
in O
1st O
. O

You O
can O
order O
the O
Lor B
Mai I
Kai I
, O
Siew B
Mai I
and O
vegetable O
too O
if O
you O
want O
, O
those O
were O
quite O
decent O
. O

With O
so O
many O
dim O
sum O
choices O
around O
the O
island O
I O
doubt O
I'll O
be O
back O
for O
more O
. O

for O
the O
tim O
sum O
. O

It O
came O
all O
broken O
even O
before O
I O
picked O
it O
up O
. O

Hard O
to O
explain O
but O
i O
wouldn't O
mind O
ordering O
it O
again O
next O
time O
. O

whats O
more O
annoying O
is O
tat O
, O
those O
tables O
submitted O
their O
order O
forms O
MUCH O
LATER O
than O
we O
did O
. O

and O
since O
I O
need O
to O
add O
on O
100 O
characters O
here O
, O
I'll O
just O
type O
away O
.. O

There O
were O
mixed O
opinions O
on O
each O
item O
but O
the O
clear O
favorite O
round O
the O
table O
were O
easily O
the O
Steamed B
Scallop I
Sausage I
Carrot I
Cake I
and O
Silky B
Custard I
Buns I
( O
I O
think O
) O

duck O
, O
the O
American-roasted B
duck I
is O
crispier O
but O
fatter O
, O
while O
the O
Beijing O
s O
version O
is O
leaner O
but O
not O
as O
crispy O
. O

don't O
understand O
why O
so O
many O
people O
like O
to O
eat O
there O
is O
very O
expensive O
and O
taste O
horrible O
! O

Heard O
about O
the O
reviews O
and O
went O
to O
try O
their O
dim O
sum O
buffet O
today O
. O

The O
waiters O
and O
waiteess O
were O
impatient O
. O

The O
BBQ B
Pork I
Bun I
and O
the O
Ma B
Lai I
Gao I
are O
definitely O
the O
2 O
best O
dishes O
here O
for O
me O
, O
as O
they O
are O
markedly O
better O
than O
their O
counterparts O
from O
the O
other O
restaurants O
that O
serve O
them O
. O

We O
were O
like O
staring O
at O
each O
other O
waiting O
for O
more O
dim-sum O
to O
come O
. O

My O
family O
was O
rather O
disappointed O
with O
the O
food O
as O
well O
. O

And O
the O
ambience O
has O
the O
' O
taste O
' O
of O
the O
90s O
and O
80s O
hongkong O
style O
! O

I O
appreciated O
the O
smoothness O
and O
silkiness O
of O
the O
tofu O
though O
and O
that O
was O
the O
sole O
redeeming O
factor O
, O
for O
me O
at O
least O
. O

The O
char O
siew O
within O
the O
cheong O
fun O
is O
still O
acceptable O
. O

We O
didn't O
plan O
to O
eat O
here O
that O
day O
. O

Do O
note O
that O
two O
seatings O
are O
available O
for O
the O
buffet O
, O
the O
first O
seating O
being O
from O
11.00 O
am O
till O
1.00 O
pm O
whereas O
the O
second O
seating O
being O
from O
1.30 O
pm O
till O
3.00 O
pm O
. O

Ambience O
is O
average O
but O
I O
wasn't O
too O
particular O
because O
my O
main O
objective O
was O
to O
satisfy O
my O
cravings O
. O

Other O
than O
this O
dish O
, O
nothing O
is O
worth O
the O
queue O
. O

We O
had O
some O
fried B
meesua I
thingie O
( O
which O
tasted O
a O
bit O
like O
carrot B
cake I
) O
which O
was O
mother O
awesome O
! O

The O
beef O
items O
were O
exceptionally O
salty O
and O
left O
an O
unpleasant O
aftertaste O
even O
after O
the O
meal O
was O
washed O
down O
with O
lots O
of O
Chinese O
tea O
. O

3 O
. O

The O
aircon O
may O
be O
alittle O
too O
cold O
sometimes O
and O
the O
Dim O
Sum O
items O
get O
cold O
too O
fast O
. O

One O
more O
thing O
, O
be O
prepared O
for O
noise O
, O
people O
just O
keep O
on O
talking O
like O
those O
Hong O
Kong O
dim O
sum O
places O
. O

Expect O
to O
be O
in O
long O
queues O
during O
the O
weekends O
. O

Walked O
all O
the O
way O
from O
Farrer O
Park O
MRT O
with O
my O
friends O
. O

Utensils O
laid O
out O
. O

Cheesecake O
aficionados O
may O
not O
enjoy O
it O
as O
much O
as O
the O
layer O
of O
cheese O
isn't O
so O
thick O
and O
the O
taste O
of O
cheese O
isn't O
as O
strong O
. O

It O
is O
usually O
crowded O
with O
long O
queue O
and O
very O
noisy O
too O
. O

Setting O
is O
just O
no O
frills O
, O
I O
have O
a O
shop O
space O
, O
a O
place O
to O
cook O
, O
a O
place O
that O
show O
some O
pictures O
of O
my O
products O
, O
a O
place O
for O
the O
customers O
to O
sit-eat-pay-goodbyes O
. O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
places O
that O
can O
be O
considered O
when O
thinking O
of O
where O
to O
eat O
dim O
sum O
for O
dinner O
or O
supper O
. O

It's O
a O
well O
kept O
secret O
I O
think O
and O
I O
only O
found O
out O
about O
this O
place O
because O
my O
gf's O
grandma O
has O
been O
dining O
here O
for O
the O
last O
30 O
years O
! O

I O
mean O
, O
we O
got O
like O
a O
20 O
% O
discount O
or O
something O
off O
the O
set O
menu O
and O
still O
, O
it O
was O
more O
than O
$ O
100 O
per O
pax O
. O

Well O
, O
the O
Steam B
Chicken I
with I
Chinese I
Wine I
was O
our O
last O
dish O
. O

So O
how O
long O
did O
I O
queue O
? O

Variety O
was O
good O
but O
the O
quality O
is O
still O
lacking O
. O

They O
gave O
us O
an O
item O
that O
we O
did O
not O
order O
and O
the O
auntie O
even O
challenged O
us O
that O
we O
did O
ordered O
that O
item O
by O
asking O
if O
we O
want O
to O
see O
our O
order O
form O
. O

Here O
goes O
! O

Mrupupup O
loved O
it O
. O

If O
not O
for O
these O
two O
, O
today's O
lunch O
would O
have O
been O
a O
total O
write O
off O
. O

about O
two O
minutes O
? O

Spring B
rolls I
are O
hot O
and O
crisp O
. O

The O
meat O
filling O
was O
scrumptious O
though O
! O

Another O
much O
overdued O
review O
of O
mine O
, O
but O
I O
finally O
got O
around O
penning O
my O
comments O
down O
. O

If O
you O
are O
intending O
to O
visit O
the O
restaurant O
, O
try O
to O
do O
so O
at O
a O
more O
abnormal O
timing O
to O
avoid O
the O
crowd O
. O

the O
skin O
was O
just O
the O
right O
thickness O
. O

Veggies O
usually O
don O
t O
excite O
me O
much O
( O
sorry O
greens O
! O

Must O
try O
the O
4 O
heavenly O
kings O
in O
the O
restaurant O
. O

This O
dish O
is O
really O
very O
very O
special O
. O

Only O
e O
egg O
tart O
is O
worth O
waiting O
and O
eating O
. O

) O
Would O
not O
recommend O
to O
patronise O
this O
place O
. O

But O
i O
will O
never O
patronise O
anymore O
in O
future O
. O

The O
filling O
was O
absolutely O
divine O
! O

it's O
a O
tad O
diff O
from O
e O
usual O
carrot O
cakes O
which O
r O
darker O
n O
fried O
longer O
.. O

Hey O
, O
their O
fried B
rice I
was O
great O
too O
! O

and O
the O
ambience O
gave O
me O
the O
impression O
of O
sitting O
in O
a O
HK O
dim O
sum O
cafe O
where O
its O
eaten O
daily O
by O
common O
people O
. O

The O
chef O
certainly O
know O
what O
he O
is O
doing O
. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
alot O
of O
times O
. O

As O
usual O
, O
we O
ordered O
our O
favorites O
- O
Siew B
Mai I
, O
Carrot B
Cake I

, O
Deep B

and O
Golden B
Egg I
Yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
, O
plus O
hot O
yin B
yang I
and O
ice B
lemon I
tea I
. O

I O
won't O
go O
out O
of O
the O
way O
for O
Victor's O
in O
future O
but O
probably O
will O
visit O
again O
if O
I'm O
in O
the O
vicinity O
for O
the O
carrot B
cake I
and O
lava B
bun I
. O

This O
to O
ensure O
the O
melting O
ice O
does O
not O
effect O
the O
texture O
and O
smoothness O
of O
the O
tea O
. O

Have O
it O
while O
it's O
piping O
hot O
. O

We O
tried O
16 O
items O
in O
total O
, O
what O
stood O
out O
for O
us O
where O

The O
food O
is O
great O
and O
the O
service O
is O
typical O
.. O

One O
thing O
to O
note O
though O
, O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
only O
accepts O
cash O
so O
remember O
to O
visit O
the O
ATM O
machine O
before O
going O
in O
. O

The O
XO O
sauce O
and O
topping O
provided O
a O
unique O
taste O
and O
spice O
to O
the O
dish O
. O

) O
- O
the O

were O
passable O
though O
they O

ve O
been O
thicker O
. O

Definitely O
not O
worth O
the O
few O
hours O
of O
q O
. O

My O
father O
ordered O
a O
delicious O
beef B
dish I
with I
veggies I
and I
ginger I
, O
it O
arrived O
sizzling O
on O
a O
hot O
plate O
. O

It O
was O
quite O
plain O
tasting O
. O

However O
, O
every O
prawn O
dumpling O
was O
generously O
packed O
with O
succulent O
, O
fresh O
and O
juicy O
prawns O
in O
a O
soft O
and O
thin O

. O

I O
ordered O

, O

The O
dim O
sum O
is O
served O
in O
traditional O
style O
, O
must-try O
includes O
the O
egg B
tart I
! O

Just O
because O
it's O
not O
well O
plated O
means O
it O
won't O
taste O
as O
good O
. O

The O
7 O
of O
us O
can O
eat O
quite O
alot O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
as O
far O
as O

( O

Like O
above O
, O
it O
was O
only O
freshly O
fried O
upon O
order O
, O
very O
crispy O
. O

Overall O
experience O
was O
fine O
, O
ambience O
was O
nice O
cosy O
, O
service O
was O
very O
good O
, O
staff O
was O
polite O
& O
attentive O
. O

The O
addition O
of O
the O
pork O
floss O
at O
the O
top O
was O
the O
icing O
on O
the O
cake O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
eg O
. O
prawns O
are O
fresh O
and O
nice O
. O

the O
food O
is O
good O
and O
you O
will O
be O
tempted O
to O
order O
everything O
that O
rolls O
past O
your O
table O
. O

It's O
crust O
is O
crumbly O
and O
when O
I O
use O
my O
chopstick O
to O
poke O
it O
slightly O
, O
it O
softly O
gives O
way O
the O
the O
awesomeness O
that O
is O
seen O
below O
. O

The O
only O
downsides O
are O
the O
location O
( O
quite O
a O
long O
walk O
if O
taking O
public O
transport O
) O
, O
the O
waiting O
time O
, O
if O
one O
wishes O
to O
enjoy O
his O
meal O
in O
cool O
air O
, O
and O
last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
the O
odd O
opening O
hours O
! O

Overall O
to O
say O
, O
I O
will O
visit O
this O
place O
again O
. O

As O
inside O
, O
it O
is O
full O
of O
buttery O
runny O
custard O
that O
is O
sweet O
, O
salty O
and O
sinful O
! O

This O
time O
two O
of O
us O
manage O
to O
gobble O
up O
so O
much O
. O

f O
) O
Har B
Gaw I
This O
dish O
is O
both O
TH's O
and O
my O
second O
favourite O
. O

As O
we O
still O
have O
food O
on O
our O
tables O
, O
we O
quickly O
continued O
eating O
to O
finish O
up O
our O
food O
and O
drinks O
. O

Thereon O
, O
you O
are O
free O
to O
walk O
around O
nearby O
malls O
while O
waiting O
for O
an O
SMS O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
your O
mobile O
, O
informing O
that O
your O
table O
is O
about O
to O
be O
ready O
. O

We O
were O
impressed O
with O
how O
they O
were O
so O
considerate O
. O

firstly O
, O
we O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
being O
seated O
, O
then O
we O
were O
given O
a O
table O
number O
and O
we O
have O
to O
search O
for O
the O
table O
number O
ourselves O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
summer B
ice I
milk I
tea I
. O

The O
Deep B
Fried I
Spring I
Roll I
was O
simply O
awesome O
! O

Maybe O
their O
quality O
has O
dropped O
over O
time O
. O

Seafood B
Fried I
Vermicelli I
- O
Plenty O
of O
seafood O
coupled O
with O
springy O
but O
a O
tad O
overly O
oily O
fried O
vermicelli O
made O
for O
a O
nice O
carbohydrate O
dish O
. O

The O
restaurant O
looks O
grand O
. O

When O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
change O
, O
she O
gave O
a O
very O
unhappy O
attitude O
, O
and O
returned O
with O
the O
same O
dirty O
chopsticks O
. O

reminded O
me O
of O
those O
i O
bot O
in O
malacca O
jonker O
street O
.. O

I O
had O
recently O
tried O
their O
xiaolongbao B
and O
it O
was O
bad O
, O
the O
meat O
inside O
did O
not O
taste O
fresh O
. O

The O
kopitiam O
style O
restaurant O
was O
huge O

, O
and O
the O
Yam B
Puree I
with I

is O
a O
modern O
twist O
of O
this O
yam O
dessert O
. O

To O
their O
defense O
however O
, O
I O
did O
not O
try O
their O
Big O
4 O
, O
so O
I O
may O
missed O
some O
plus O
points O
for O
the O
restaurant O
. O

And O
normally O
, O
the O
iced O
tea O
we O
drink O
is O
very O
sweet O
thanks O
to O
the O
ice O
cubes O
thrown O
in O
. O

(: O
they O
have O
four O
signature O
dishes O
called O
the O
Big O
4 O
Heavenly O
Kings O
. O

anyway O
it O
mattered O
not O
as O
customer O
would O
just O
vote O
with O
their O
feet O
i O
love O
bringing O
my O
dim O

loving O

here O
on O
the O

its O
dim O

There O
has O
been O
sufficient O
raves O
abt O
this O
place O
. O

Definitely O
a O
good O
place O
for O
fine O
dinning O
lovers O
! O

This O
way O
, O
the O
drink O
is O
kept O
chilled O
without O
diluting O
the O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
drink O
. O

Better O
go O
Tim O

This O
is O
the O
place O
to O
go O
when O
you O
are O
hungry O
at O

and O
don't O
wish O

her O
choice O
of O

was O
just O
plain O

Although O
there O
were O
more O
than O
30 O
people O
lined O
up O
in O

of O
us O
, O
we O
waited O
for O
a O
mere O
20mins O

I O
was O
expecting O
the O
Scallop B
, I
Sausage I
Carrot I
Cake I
( O
$ O
4 O
) O
to O
be O
the O
pan O
fried O
types O
that O
are O
common O
nowadays O
so O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
see O
that O
it O
was O
steamed O
in O
a O
bowl O
and O
topped O
with O
sauce O
. O

The O
sliced B
fish I
with I
broccoli I
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
food O
arrived O
over O
the O
course O
of O
2 O
hours O
. O

The O
chrysanthemum O
tea O
provided O
much O
needed O
culinary O
sanity O
in O
this O
traumatising O
meal O
. O

And O
while O
he O
seemed O
to O
be O
knowledgable O
enough O
about O
the O
menu O
, O
he O
didn't O
seem O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
a O
few O
common O
courtesies O
one O
would O
only O
excuse O
in O
Wong O
Kei's O
in O
London O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
the O
ambience O
was O
bewitching O
and O
there O
were O
certainly O
very O
memorable O
and O
enticing O
dishes O
which O
made O
our O
visit O
to O
Cherry O
Garden O
, O
a O
very O
delightful O
and O
scumptious O
experience O
. O

The O
dimsum O
we O
ordered O
include O
siew B
mai I
, O
har B
gao I
( O
shrimp B
dumpling I
) O
, O
steamed B
pork I
ribs I
, O
fried B
prawn I
rolls I
and O
custard B
buns I
. O

They've O
definitely O
lost O
us O
as O
customers O
. O

The O
name O
s O
scallop B
, I
sausage I
carrot I
cake I
with I
xo I
sauce I
, O
but O
i O
hardly O
had O
any O
hint O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
scallop O
and O
sausage O
in O
it O
, O
and O
i O
think O
i O
still O
preferred O
my O
carrot B
cake I
to O
be O
fried O
than O
soup O
. O

and O
my O
personal O
favourite O
. O

They O
place O
the O
ice O
on O
the O
outside O
of O
the O
cup O
to O
chill O
down O
the O
drink O
. O

Ever O
tried O
the O
Chinese O
dishes O
and O
Dim O
Sum O
in O
this O
restaurant O
in O
a O
few O
family O
gatherings O
. O

Lor B
Mai I
Kai I
- O
an O
utter O
disappointment O
! O

It O
was O
a O
tasty O
treat O
amongst O
all O
the O
savoury O
foods O
that O
we O
had O
. O

Initially O
I O
did O
not O
think O
much O
of O
that O
dish O
yet O
when O
I O
tried O
it O
I O
was O
taken O
aback O
. O

Their O
staffs O
are O
very O
well O
trained O
and O
efficient O
. O

We O
don't O
understand O
mandarin O
, O
but O
it O
seemed O
that O
she O
upset O
. O

Ambience O
is O
typical O
chinese O
restaurant O
style O
with O
the O
waitresses O
in O
trolleys O
bringing O
the O
dim O
sum O
to O
you O
. O

We O
had O
recommended O
- O
porridge B
( O
only O
one O
type O
) O
, O
egg B
tarts I
, O
carrot B
cake I
, O
chee B
cheong I
fun I
with O
prawn O
, O
so-so O
- O
fried B
prawn I
ball I
w I
sugarcane I
stick I
, O
siew B
mai I
, O
almond B
jelly I
w I
longan I
for O
dessert O
. O

Most O
of O
friends O
who O
have O
been O
to O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
they O
preferred O
the O
authentic O
taste O
at O
there O
. O

Vermicelli B

( O
- O
) O
We O
were O
served O
vinegar O
as O
accompanying O
condiments O
instead O
of O
mayonnaise O
, O
though O
was O
replaced O
after O
we O
requested O
. O

From O
what O
I O
could O
see O
, O
the O
only O
reason O
why O
there O
is O
a O
queue O
is O
because O
the O
staff O
is O
badly O
trained O
and O
the O
space O
is O
pathetically O
small O
, O
therefore O
resulting O
in O
a O
queue O
forming O
. O

Immediately O
, O
you O
would O
realize O
that O
you O
just O
had O
something O
very O
special O
. O

century B
porridge I
was O
smooth O
enough O
, O
but O
not O
special O
enough O
to O
make O
an O
impression O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
being O
curious O
, O
we O
ordered O
the O
dish O
anyway O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
an O
absolute O
no O
regret O
! O

Juice O
oozing O
out O
the O
moment O
you O
break O
the O
skin O
. O

not O
worth O
the O
time O
and O
money O
. O

And O
it's O
2 O
big O
slices O
every O
order O
very O
filling O
! O
! O

It O
is O
a O
midnight O
dim O
sum O
haunt O
around O
town O
( O
apart O
from O
Geylang O
) O
, O
not O
only O
that O
, O
to O
be O
able O
to O
taste O
fresh O
dim O
sum O
into O
wee O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
, O
this O
is O
the O
one O
to O
visit O
. O

I O
was O
very O
impressed O
by O
the O
restaurant O
classic O
deco O
, O
quiet O
and O
peaceful O
ambience O
. O

Not O
a O
custard B
bun I
by O
any O
way O
but O
hot O
flowing O
sweet O
savoury O
butter O
and O
a O
bit O
of O
salted O
egg O
inside O
a O
bun O
. O

Service O
is O
not O
too O
bad O
as O
they O
have O
at O
least O
2 O
trolley O
for O
one O
kind O
of O
Dim O
Sum O
. O

It O
came O
immersed O
in O
a O
bowl O
of O
ice O
, O
instead O
of O
having O
the O
ice O
in O
the O
drink O
. O

There O
we O
already O
people O
gathered O
outside O
watching O
the O
movie O
unfolding O
inside O
. O

Food O
is O
disappointing O
and O
I O
really O
pity O
those O
who O
queue O
long O
time O
for O
such O
low O
quality O
. O

Was O
there O
on O
Sunday O
with O
a O
friend O
at O
about O
3.30 O
pm O
. O

Egg B
Tart I
( O
$ O
2.60+ O
/ O
2 O
) O
:: O
It O
was O
forgettable O
. O

I O
have O
heard O
so O
much O
good O
things O
about O
this O
dish O
from O
friends O
that O
I O
was O
initially O
quite O
afraid O
that O
I O
might O
be O
disappointed O
. O

The O
Mee B
Sua I
Kueh I
kind O
of O
reminds O
me O
of O
Maggi O
Mee O
. O

To O
thnk O
that O
this O
shop O
is O
from O
Hong O
Kong O
, O
and O
got O
michelin O
star O
. O

* O
the O
sweet O
dim O

Let O
there O
be O
more O
, O
say O
fish O
siew O
mai O
? O

The O
Kurobuta O
Pork O
was O
tender O
and O
chewy O
, O
while O
some O
slices O
were O
roasted O
to O
certain O
crisp O
. O

Braised B
Ee-Fu I
Noodles I

Mushrooms I
, I

and I

; O
the O
texture O
of O
the O
Ee-Fu O
noodles O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
smoothest O
I O
have O
had O
. O

I O
didn't O
expect O
any O
ambience O
or O
fantastic O
service O
( O
which O
I O
rated O
at O
7.5 O
because O
it O
meets O
my O
expectations O
; O
my O
food O
comes O
fast O
and O
that's O
good O
enough O
for O
me O
) O
since O
this O
is O
a O
coffee O
shop O
type O
establishment O
, O
but O
I O
don't O
care O
, O
because O
the O
food O
is O
good O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
reasonable O
. O

When O
I O
heard O
that O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
apparently O
serves O
out O
one O
of O
the O
better O
dim O
sums O
in O
Singapore O
, O
I O
was O
really O
excited O
about O
checking O
the O
place O
out O
. O

The O
standard O
fares O
can O
be O
found O
, O
siew B
mai I
, O

. O
quite O

Worth O

2nd O

There O
s O
no O
trace O

, O
or O
maybe O
i O
happened O
to O
miss O

Then O
we O
finally O

A O
very O
popular O
question O
, O
is O
it O
of O
the O
same O
standard O
? O

and O
regretted O
. O

however O
, O
the O
ones O
in O
singapore O
is O
only O
average O
. O

Came O
here O
w O
grp O
of O
13 O
. O

But O
for O
a O
person O
like O
me O
who O
has O
never O
liked O
siew B
mai I
, O
telling O
you O
that O
here O
at O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
, O
it O
was O
good O
, O
you O
probably O
wouldn't O
want O
to O
miss O
it O
. O

The O
food O
was O
not O
bad O
, O
I O
particularly O
liked O
the O
durian B
pancakes I
even O
though O
durian O
isn't O
my O
favourite O
food O
. O

Nice O
tea O
break O
for O
the O
team O
. O

all-famous O
traditional O
Dim O
Sum O
Restaurant O
that O
has O
been O
around O
for O
the O
longest O
time O
, O
Red O
Star O
Restaurant O
isn O
t O
the O
most O
accessible O
of O
it O
all O
, O
but O
I O
guess O
it O
suits O
its O
surrounding O
location O
, O
at O
Chin O
Swee O
Road O
, O
just O
as O
of O
heritage O
value O
and O
traditional O
. O

Everyone O
at O
the O
table O
could O
not O
stop O
raving O
about O
the O
extremely O
tender O
nature O
of O
the O
liver O
and O
how O
it O
lent O
a O
flavourful O
touch O
to O
those O
silken O
smooth O
vermicelli O
rolls O
. O

Moreover O
it O
opens O
till O
wee O
hours O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

However O
, O
those O
pre-fried O
ones O
will O
be O
kept O
in O
a O
warm O
glass O
case O
, O
you O
will O
have O
to O
compromise O
on O
the O
texture O
and O
freshness O
front O
. O

So O
much O
of O
self-service O
, O
but O
the O
worst O
is O
that O
the O
utensils O
were O
not O
cleaned O
properly O
. O

Victor's O
Kitchen O
was O
packed O
! O

The O
Phoenix B
Porridge I
( O
$ O
4 O
) O
was O
good O
for O
2 O
to O
share O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
feel O
that O
some O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
is O
better O
that O
crystal O
jade O
and O
of O
course O
cheaper O
than O
crystal O
jade O
. O

I O
visited O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
last O
saturday O
with O
my O
family O
. O

- O
Japanese B
Cucumber I
& I
Black I
Fungus I
Salad I
( O
$ O
2.50 O
) O
. O

The O
har B
gow I
skin O
was O
too O
thick O
. O

The O
last O
time O
i O
was O
there O
, O
we O
onli O
paid O
$ O
100 O
over O
for O
ten O
odd O
person O
. O

The O
menu O
with O
the O
prices O
. O

We O
went O
there O
for O
late O
dinner O
. O

Quite O
disappointed O
as O
only O
the O
Baked B
buns I
with I
BBQ I
pork I
is O
yummy O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
one O
of O
my O
favorite O
dim O
sum O
places O
, O
and O
it O
well O
deserves O
its O
Michelin O
star O
! O

The O
custard O
is O
not O
crispy O
, O
I O
think O
is O
because O
less O
butter O
added O
to O
it O
and O
tasteless O
. O

Menu O
choices O
were O
not O
much O
. O

The O
roasted O
BBQ O
meat O
platter O
includes O
Roasted B
duck I
, O
Roasted B
pork I
belly I
and O
Kurobuta B
Char I
Siew I
. O

Lucky O
for O
us O
, O
now O
we O
can O
all O
have O
dim O
sum O
even O
at O
midnight O
or O
in O
the O
wee O
hours O
of O
the O
morning O
! O

For O
first O
timers O
, O
it O
s O
cold O
, O
spicy O
, O
salty O
, O
and O
pure O
brilliance O
. O

After O
having O
our O
bill O
changed O
3 O
times O
as O
there O
were O
intems O
on O
it O
that O
we O
didn't O
order O
or O
ever O
receive O
. O

So O
its O
the O
best O
value O
.. O

A O
very O
traditional O
dim O
sum O
place O
with O
push O
carts O
. O

Dont O
waste O
your O
time O
here O
I O
cant O
believe O
i O
actually O
made O
an O
account O
on O
hungrygowhere O
. O

The O
xiao B
long I
bao I
was O
very O
shiok O
. O

Tea O
is O
refilled O
frequently O
and O
empty O
plates O
and O
baskets O
are O
cleared O
promptly O
. O

We O
arrived O
in O
the O
evening O
of O
a O
weekday O
and O
although O
there O
was O
no O
line O
the O
tim O
sum O
cart O
was O
not O
available O
. O

Finally O
got O
so O
frustrated O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
leave O
. O

Non O
pretentious O
food O
place O
and O
I O
wonder O
who O
or O
where O
is O
Victor O
as O
the O
lady O
at O
the O
counter O
looks O
too O
feminine O
to O
be O
a O
man O
as O
she O
powder O
her O
nose O
repeatedly O
several O
times O
while O
I O
was O
there O
. O

It's O

:P O
Actually O
, O
now O
I O
am O
just O
wondering O

The O

you O

you O
ask O

have O
some O

about O

We O
did O
suffer O
slightly O
from O
having O
a O
table O
of O
inconsiderate O

in O

though O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
we O
looked O
around O

nearly O

none O
could O
become O

I O
saw O
quite O
a O
few O

the O

1 O

actually O
asking O
her O

the O

you O

The O

packed O

The O
exterior O
of O

fluffy O

a O

the O
inside O

gone O
from O

Finally O

we O
managed O
to O
get O
a O
table O

Surprisingly O
, O
I O
liked O
the O
Xiao B

though O
there O
wasn't O
much O
soup O
and O
the O
skin O
was O
quite O
thick O

We O
always O
have O
dim O

on O
the O
second O
day O
of O
CNY O
and O
it O
is O
always O
very O
crowded O

It O
was O
meant O
to O
be O
a O
catch O
up O
dinner O
and O
although O
my O
last O
experience O
at O
Cherry O
Garden O
was O
forgettable O
( O
due O
to O
the O
less O
than O
ideal O
quality O
and O
quantity O
of O
food O
) O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
give O
the O
restaurant O
yet O
another O
chance O
. O

This O
, O
was O
a O
poisonous O

Now O
I O
know O
that O
I O
don't O
always O

put O
up O

it O

the O

the O

have O
to O
squeeze O
through O
the O

they O
put O
their O

must O
say O
the O

the O
most O
, O
though O
I O
found O
the O

and O
rich O

The O
prices O
are O
really O
reasonable O

We O
had O
three O
tables O
and O
so O
was O
glad O
to O
be O
given O

tables O
in O
a O
secluded O
corner O

Might O
not O
even O
choose O
to O
dine O
here O
sans O

For O
me O
, O
I O
really O
disliked O
the O
cloying O
sweetness O
of O
the O
char O
siew O
fillings O
, O
it O
was O
just O
too O
much O
for O
me O
, O
and O
so O
I O
struggled O
to O
finish O
the O
bun O
. O

Sigh O
! O

i O
have O
to O
keep O
looking O
out O
at O
the O
kitchen O
direction O
, O
and O
guessed O
the O
food O
that O
was O
coming O
out O
, O
and O
made O
my O
way O
there O
to O
try O
to O
pick O
up O
some O
dim O
sums O
. O

From O
someone O
who O
abhors O
and O
tries O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
fats O
, O
this O

is O
super O

absolutely O

unquestionably O
and O
utterly O
delectable O

Attention O
all O
men O

this O

definitely O
the O
place O
to O
be O
taking O
your O

to O

alot O
of O

choose O

If O
you O
have O
tried O

at O
Crystal O
Jade O
, O
you O
will O
agree O
with O
me O
that O
the O
taste O
is O
really O
similar O
! O

But O
really O
, O
it O
does O
diminish O
the O
restaurant's O
painstakingly O
created O
classy O
atmosphere O
when O
you O
allow O
other O
diners O
to O
be O
so O
crassly O
inconsiderate O
. O

Not O
many O
places O
offering O
such O
rustic O
feel O
to O
the O
dim O
sum O
that O
I O
used O
to O
grow O
up O
with O

Service O
Nothing O
short O
of O
excellent O
with O

tea O
consistently O
refilled O
and O
the O
flexibility O
exercised O
in O
ordering O
the O
food O
. O

The O
har B
gao I
was O
really O
hot O
and O
the O
prawns O
inside O
were O
crunchy O
, O
but O
otherwise O
unmemorable O
. O

Indeed O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
every O
table O
is O
roughly O
given O
5mins O
to O
order O
, O
5mins O
to O
receive O
all O
the O
food O
and O
another O
10mins O
to O
finish O
up O
and O
leave O
. O

The O
time O
is O
relevant O
because O
going O
on O
a O
Sunday O
7pm O
might O
result O
in O
a O
wait O
time O
of O
hours O
! O

food O
takes O
forever O
to O
come O
even O
though O
it O
was O
empty O

it O
wasnt O
too O
salty O

but O
as O
with O
the O
sliced O

, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
oily O

not O

really O
nothing O
out O

The O
rest O
of O
the O

decent O
enough O

Take O
a O

Perhaps O
, O
I O
may O
have O
been O
putting O
too O
much O
hope O

this O

An O
establishment O
that O
has O
been O
around O
for O
some O
time O
. O

The O
chicken O
was O
tender O
and O
the O
chinese O
sausage O
palatable O
, O
the O
fragrant O
and O
soft O
rice O
, O
all O
the O
combinations O
made O
the O
glutinous B

a O
praiseworthy O
dish O

Worth O
to O
go O
for O
the O
brunch O
. O

it O
also O
has O
it's O
fair O
share O
of O
supper O
delights O
and O
this O
place O
is O
cheaper O
than O
some O
Tim O
Sum O
. O

I O
do O
know O
I'm O
looking O
out O
for O
other O
good O
dim O
sum O
places O
, O
and O
would O
give O
up O
the O
wonderfully O
nostalgic O
atmosphere O
of O
Red O

for O
the O
promise O
of O
better O
food O
. O

Thumbs O
up O
from O
me O
. O

Some O
dishes O
are O
a O
bit O
too O
salted O
. O

We O
also O
ordered O
some O
Siew B
Mai I
( O
$ O
1.80 O
for O
2 O
) O
which O
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
was O
so-so O
and O
nothing O
to O
shout O
about O
. O

I'm O
glad O
that O
we O
were O
familiar O
with O
the O
area O
and O
decided O
to O
visit O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
which O
is O
just O
a O
short O
drive O
down O
Jalan O

to O
Bencoolen O

i O
liked O
however O
one O
of O
my O
companions O
claimed O
that O
hers O
tasted O
like O

that's O

Hersing O
Corporation O
Pte O
Ltd O
has O
kindly O
invested O
in O
the O
SMS O
Sytem O
, O
such O
that O
patrons O
only O
need O
to O
stand O
in O
line O
to O
obtain O
a O
queue O
number O
. O

Their O
policy O
of O
not O
seating O
guests O

the O
entire O
party O
is O

is O
also O
a O
good O
one O
- O
it O
minimizes O
time O
taken O
per O

once O
seated O
. O

We O
waited O
30 O
mins O
, O
and O
they O
got O
us O
a O
table O
. O

and O
i O
do O
think O
that O
it O
is O
quite O
affordable O
, O
considering O
the O
size O
of O
the O
bun O
! O
! O

A O
lot O
of O
5 O
star O
hotels O
in O
Singapore O
are O
facing O
an O
acute O
shortage O
of O
well O
trained O
staff O
and O
I O
was O
amazed O
to O
see O
this O
simple O
eatery O
following O
the O
basic O
principles O
of O
customer O
service O
to O
the O
core O
. O

Here's O
a O
rundown O
of O
what O
we O
had O
: O
Ice B
Milk I
Tea I
. O

Verdict O
: O
7.5 O
/ O
10I O
have O
always O
thought O
that O
a O
dim O
sum O
chef O
should O
be O
assessed O
on O
3 O
simple O
yet O
intricate O
dishes O
, O
namely O
har B
gao I
, O
siew B
mai I
and O
lo B
bak I
go I
. O

( O
bbq B
pork I
rice I
$ O
2.20 O
) O
- O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
fan B
choy I
but O
it O
turned O
out O
surprisingly O
well O
. O

overall O
, O
a O
good O
place O
for O
good O
food O
( O
comparable O
to O
those O
i O
tried O
in O
HK O
) O
at O
affordable O
prices O
. O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
here O
after O
clubbing O
at O
St O
James O
. O

I O
will O
leave O
them O
to O
write O
their O
reviews O
but O
my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
of O
coz O
* O
what O
else O
? O

The O
filling O
was O
delicious O
and O
the O
dough O
wasn't O
very O
thick O
. O

I O
really O
miss O
that O
! O

Fried B
Wanton I
in O
3s O
SGD O
2.50 O
- O
1 O
Normal O
taste O
with O
big O
wanton O
skin O
that O
is O
very O
crispy O
. O

Then O
again O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
outside O
the O
kitchen O
for O
the O
staffs O
to O
push O
out O
the O
cart O
so O
that O
we O
can O
take O
the O
food O
. O

:-P O
Take O
Note O
... O

Our O
favorite O
was O
the O
BBQ B
pork I
bun I
. O

The O
glazed O
kurobuta B
char I
siew I
pau I
( O
three O
for O
$ O
5.80 O
) O
is O
probably O
the O
best O
char O
siew O
pau O
we O
ve O
had O
, O
ever O
. O

They O
are O
not O
people O
in O
nice O
ironed O
uniform O
, O
it's O
just O
like O
a O
little O
family O
business O
. O

My O
friends O
and O
I O
have O
been O
wanting O
to O
try O
the O
Liu B
Sha I
Bao I
from O
Swee O
Choon O
and O
we O
finally O
had O
the O
chance O
to O
visit O
them O
last O
night O
! O

essentially O
, O
its O
using O
two O
layers O
of O
boiling O
to O
protect O
the O
special O
ingredients O
. O

This O
dish O
is O
a O
traditional O
Cantonese O
dish O
. O

The O
entire O
pumpkin O
snack O
was O
practically O
glazed O
and O
glittering O
with O
oil O
. O

My O
advice O
is O
, O
Please O
Do O
Give O
it O
a O
try O
and O
you O
will O
start O
to O
appreciate O
other O
local O
Dim O
Sum O
Restaurants O
. O

I O
spent O
about O
$ O
24 O
in O
total O
, O
which O
is O
an O
acceptable O
price O
to O
pay O
. O

We O
ordered O
just O
a O
few O
items O
to O
just O
get O
a O
flavor O
and O
the O
items O
were O
all O
delicious O
. O

Shiok O
! O

I O
personally O
like O
the O
Hor B
Fun I
and O
steamed B
vermicelli I
roll I
. O

- O
yeah O
ikr O
:( O

It O
was O
deep O
fried O
with O
a O
slightly O
salty O
covering O
and O
very O
soft O
and O
tender O
inside O
when O
you O
bite O
into O
it O
. O

Nice O
notes O
of O
sesame O
oil O
. O

! O

The O
pastry O
was O
flaky O
and O
crisp O
, O
but O
a O
tad O
too O
oily O
. O

it's O
like O
a O
cheaper O
alternative O
for O
dingtaifung O
, O
but O
that O
is O
if O
u O
don O
mind O
the O
place O
being O
rather O
noisy O
. O

This O
is O
a O
really O
popular O
supper O
hangout O
for O
me O
and O
my O
friends O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
serves O
very O
good O
Tim O
sum O
and O
a O
pretty O
cheap O
price O
. O

Do O
not O
expect O
any O
ambience O
or O
fantastic O
service O
though O
. O

But O
anyway O
, O
the O
rest O
is O
still O
okay O
. O

No O
wonder O
, O
this O
place O
is O
swarming O
with O
rave O
reviews O
. O

Slightly O
bland O
, O
and O
need O
to O
add O
the O
soya O
sauce O
to O
give O
more O
flavour O
to O
the O
dish O
. O

place O
was O
introduced O
by O
a O
friend O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
which O
is O
one O
of O
her O
favorite O
supper O
place O
. O

Dried I
Scallops I
and I
Shrimps I
; O
as O
exquisite O
as O
the O
name O
might O
suggest O
, O
I O
felt O
that O
this O
dish O
is O
worth O
the O
order O
solely O
due O
to O
the O
generous O
servings O
of O
succulent O
shrimps O
within O
the O
Dumpling O
. O

The O
glutinous B
rice I
was O
overcooked O
and O
while O
retaining O
the O
moisture O
trapped O
underneath O
the O
lotus O
leaf O
, O
it O
was O
soft O
and O
mushy O
. O

I O
only O
have O
one O
thing O
to O
say O
about O
this O
place O
.. O
YOU O
DIE O
DIE O
ALSO O
MUST O
HAVE O
THE O
DAN O
( O
EGG O
) O
TART O
! O

This O
is O
one O
of O
the O
oldest O
restaurant O
still O
going O
strong O
. O

A O
recommended O
place O
to O
visit O
if O
you O
haven O
t O
been O
here O
but O
whether O
it O
s O
worth O
another O
visit O
is O
really O
subjective O
. O

The O
patrons O
are O
mostly O
chinese O
, O
very O
few O
foreigners O
here O
. O

The O

wasn't O
too O
bad O
. O

Definitely O
value O
for O
money O
, O
which O
explained O
the O
brisk O
business O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
rainy O
day O
and O
we O
went O
early O
at O
about O
6.30 O
pm O
so O
getting O
a O
table O
was O
easy O
. O

They O
clear O
plates O
really O
quickly O
so O
that O
your O
table O
is O
not O
cluttered O
. O

Been O
to O

me O
about O
2hours O
to O

Have O
tim O

also O
. O

I O
didn't O
think O
too O
much O
about O
the O
sauce O
though O
. O

The O
meat O
in O
the O
XLB B
is O
really O
flavorful O
and O
the O
soup O
is O
oh-so-yums O
! O

The O
white O
bun O
was O
light O
and O
fluffy O
but O
that's O
the O
main O
point O
. O

With O
EH's O

I O
went O
with O
Lily O
and O
Danny O
to O
Cherry O
Garden O
for O
dinner O
. O

To O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
, O
we O
had O
a O

As O
it O
is O
a O

the O

was O
full O

The O

not O
wow O
me O
at O
all O

Other O
than O
that O

for O
the O

Served O
with O
port O
sauce O
that O
complements O
it O
so O
nicely O
. O

The O
traditional O
push O

style O
was O
nostalgic O
though O
. O

Was O
given O
2 O
glossy O
menus O
and O
an O
order O
pad O
and O
pencil O
. O

I O
love O
yam O
and O
this O
dish O
is O
really O
yummy O
! O

Now O
I O
have O
a O
flashback O
of O
the O
old O
Mcdonald's O
commercial O
of O
the O
2 O
chinese O
women O
wearing O
their O

, O

Baked B
Bun I
with I
BBQ I
Pork I
( O
3pcs O
) O
$ O
4.50 O
If O
I O
really O
have O
to O
mention O
that O
ONE O
dish O
that O
is O
a O
must-try O
, O
it O
has O
to O
go O
to O
their O
Baked B
Bun I
with I
BBQ I
Pork I
! O

I O
like O
the O
sandy O
texture O
of O
the O
custard O
, O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
oily O
for O
my O
liking O
. O

The O
portions O
indeed O
are O
very O
small O
, O
cant O
really O
fill O
one's O
stomach O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
not O
cheap O
though O
. O

But O
for O
the O
rest O
, O
omg O
the O
salt O
level O
is O
MAX O
, O
feel O
always O
very O
thirsty O
after O
eating O
there O
. O

Sweet O
but O
not O
cloying O
, O
the O
meat O
is O
diced O
into O
petite O
cubes O
. O

The O
only O
disappointment O
was O
the O
big O
shrimp O
with O
chives O
har B
gao I
. O

This O
place O
deserves O
an O
award O
- O
but O
not O
for O
its O
food O
. O

Their O
Pork B
Ribs I
were O
also O
very O
juicy O
and O
tender O
, O
not O
too O
very O
hard O
to O
chew O
and O
with O
every O
bite O
one O
could O
taste O
perfect O
harmony O
between O
the O
meat O
& O
its O
sauce O
. O

The O
location O
is O
convenient O
as O
well O
. O

hahah O
food O
tastes O
better O
when O
you're O
hungry O
! O

There O
were O
also O
new O
dishes O
like O
and O
. O

This O
seems O
like O
the O
more O
popular O
dessert O
over O
there O
. O

I O
realised O
it O
s O
either O
you O
hate O
it O
or O
you O
love O
it O
. O

The O
waiting O
time O
for O
food O
could O
be O
faster O
, O
esp O
. O

An O
ordering O
chit O
had O
been O
given O
to O
us O
way O
back O
at O
the O
queue O
, O
so O
once O
you O
are O
seated O
all O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
to O
submit O
the O
ordering O
chit O
and O
you O
are O
almost O
on O
the O
way O
to O
having O
food O
. O

Exception O
being O
the O
steamed B
bamboo I
and I
prawn I
dumpling I
with I
gold I
powder I
( O
luxurious O
) O
and O
conpoy B
dumpling I
( O
full O
of O
fresh O
seafood O
flavours O
) O
, O
as O
seen O
in O
my O
photos O
. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
an O
oldies O
feel O
and O
it O
is O
very O
spacious O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
the O
service O
and O
attitude O
of O
the O
receptionist O
and O
waiting O
staff O
was O
pleasant O
and O
polite O
, O
certainly O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
the O
flagship O
eatery O
at O
Mongkok O
. O

Personally O
, O
i O
love O
this O
restaurant O
' O
thousand B
layer I
cake I
' O
where O
it O
is O
almost O
impossible O
to O
find O
other O
dim O
sum O
restaurant O
or O
it O
is O
forzen O
but O
in O
this O
restaurant O
they O
are O
frshly O
made O
! O

And O
oh O
wait O
, O
there O
s O
something O
hiding O
below O
the O
feathers O
; O
the O
netted O
rice O
crispy O
I O
meant O
. O

hahah O
but O
the O
bao O
was O
really O
soft O
and O
fluffy O
and O
the O
char O
siew O
was O
simply O
good O
! O

We O
paid O
$ O
500 O
+ O
for O
the O
meal O
, O
because O
of O
the O
discount O
voucher O
, O
but O
the O
original O
cost O
should O
have O
been O
$ O
700 O
+ O
, O
including O
Chinese O
Tea O
and O
taxes O
. O

King B
Prawn I
Chee I
Cheong I
Fun I
( O
$ O
4.00 O
) O
was O
enjoyable O
, O
with O
the O
rice O
roll O
of O
the O
right O
thickness O
. O

Not O
a O
single O
waitstaff O
came O
to O
clear O
the O
table O
. O

The O
doggy-bagged O
serving O
still O
tastes O
good O
by O
the O
time O
I O
got O
home O
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
the O
price O
ain't O
cheap O
either O
. O

Obviously O
we O
are O
a O
family O
of O
4 O
, O
after O
placing O
the O
order O
, O
utensils O
were O
given O
but O
it O
is O
always O
in O
sets O
of O
3 O
. O

Thankfully O
the O
turnover O
is O
pretty O
fast O
and O
we O
waited O
probably O
no O
more O
than O
15 O
minutes O
. O

i O
thought O
this O
was O
pretty O
neat O
, O
considering O
other O
places O
which O
served O
ice O
milk B
tea I

the O

the O

the O

even O
better O
by O

Since O

but O
let's O
back O
track O
a O
little O
to O
a O
question O
so O
basic O
that O
many O
of O
us O
take O
for O
granted O
: O
is O
it O
free O
seating O
or O
will O
there O
be O
a O
hostess O
to O
guide O
u O
to O
ur O
tables O
? O

When O
i O
paid O
for O
the O
meal O
and O
made O
my O
way O
out O
of O
the O
restaurant O

the O
same O
waiter O

me O

looked O

something O
commonly O
found O
in O
other O
dim O
sum O
places O

form O
before O
this O
shop O
opens O
, O
and O
the O
business O
hours O
starts O
from O
12 O
noon O
. O

As O
we O
already O
knew O
that O
there O
would O
be O
a O
long O
queue O
if O
we O
arrived O
late O
, O
we O
made O
it O
a O

After O
you O

then O

The O

and O
we O
had O
difficulties O
placing O

ended O
stacking O
them O

The O

OK O

you O
want O
to O

OK O
, O
a O
little O

for O
my O
taste O
; O
you O
can O
find O
better O
at O
many O
local O
dim O

outlets O
; O
- O
two O
best O
dishes O
were O
the O

very O
light O

not O
oily O
and O
the O

nice O

not O

really O
very O

; O
- O
finally O
the O
chili O

served O
here O
is O
way O
to O
sweet O

It's O
like O

The O
consistency O
of O
the O
porridge B
was O
smooth O
. O

Food O
came O
fast O
and O
furious O
therafter O
a O
short O
wait O
. O

One O
recommendation O
: O
serve O
some O
of O
the O
dim O
sums O
in O
bigger O
quantities O
. O

So O
it O
allowed O
us O
to O
see O
the O
full O
range O
of O
dim O
sum O
offered O
, O
and O
one O
can O
always O
decide O
what O
new O
items O
to O
try O
too O
. O

Heard O
abt O
this O
from O
a O
business O
contact O
so O
went O
to O
order O
the O
take O
away O
yu B
sheng I
. O

My O
first O
time O
eating O
there O
, O
and O
I O
cannot O
help O
but O
feel O
that O
I O
have O
wasted O
my O
calories O
on O
bad O
food O
and O
not O
to O
mention O
really O
bad O
service O
. O

Than O
I O
started O
to O
talk O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
say O
that O
we O
are O
different O
customer O
from O
the O
very O
first O
time O
, O
they O
come O
later O
, O
ordering O
in O
a O
different O
time O
although O
we O
share O
table O
. O

Ommmm O
... O

From O
the O
moment O
you O
enter O
, O
they O
will O
try O
to O
rush O
you O
in O
, O
rush O
you O
to O
order O
, O
rush O
you O
to O
eat O
( O
by O
placing O
all O
the O
food O
on O
your O
table O
even O
when O
it's O
obvious O
there O
is O
no O
space O
to O
put O
any O
more O
dishes O
) O
and O
rush O
you O
out O
. O

By O
then O
, O
we O
together O
with O
other O
customers O
started O
to O
realise O
that O
a O
few O
MOM O
officers O
were O
here O
to O
catch O
illegal O
workers O
. O

The O
roast B
duck I
drumstick I
was O
chopped O
into O
several O
pieces O
and O
tasted O
quite O
normal O
though O
the O
crispy O
skin O
is O
a O
plus O
. O

Namely O
the O
xiao B
long I
bao I
, O
chicken B

, O

, O
fried B
mee I
suah I
, O

, O

and O
si B

. O

It O
was O
rather O
pricy O
at O
$ O
3 O
per O
bowl O
and O
was O
the O
only O
big O
disappointment O
in O
taste O
factor O
for O
me O
. O

they O
have O
a O
very O
prompt O
and O
systematic O
ordering O
service O
- O
staff O
was O
nice O
and O
efficient O
too O
. O

however O
service O
attidue O
can O
be O
bad O
at O
busy O
hours O
like O
sunday O
morning O
! O

I O
will O
stand O
for O
the O
badly O
trained O
staffs O

if O
the O
price O
is O
half O

Two O
of O
my O
friends O
ordered O
this O
dish O
and O
they O
commented O
that O
the O
beef O
tasted O
weird O
. O

The O
skin O
is O
not O
too O
thin O
such O
that O
it O
is O
not O
as O
difficult O
to O
pick O
it O
up O
without O
breaking O
the O
skin O
. O

The O
char O
siew O
filling O
within O
the O
rice O
roll O
was O
too O
little O
to O
make O
an O
impact O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
anyone O
to O
go O
and O
try O
themselves O
and O
i O
am O
sure O
i O
will O
be O
right O
in O
recommending O
this O
place O
. O

And O
because O
the O
restaurant O
was O
really O
busy O
on O
weekends O
, O
instead O
of O
waiting O
for O
the O
push O
carts O
to O
come O
to O
us O

we O
were O
searching O
for O
the O

wanted O

Arriving O
around O
1pm O
, O
I O
wasn't O
sure O
if O
it O
would O
be O
full O
, O
but O
there O
were O
a O
few O
empty O
spots O
so O
we O
were O
in O
luck O
. O

The O
place O
is O
able O
to O
accommodate O
a O
large O
group O
of O
people O

i O

it O
was O

We O
ate O

this O

although O
alittle O
hard O
to O
locate O
, O
offers O
some O
authentic O
old O
hk O

, O
right O
down O

I O
liked O
the O
Sponge O
Cake O
for O
it O
was O
dense O
and O
sweet O
of O
the O
right O
appropriateness O
; O
and O
it O
really O
reminded O
us O
of O
the O
genuine O
home-made O
Chinese O
Traditional O
Sponge O
Cakes O
. O

Well O
, O
to O
me O
, O
decoration O
is O
not O
important O
at O
all O
. O

Partly O
our O
fault O
that O
we O
didn't O
bother O
to O
raise O
the O
issue O
with O
our O
waitress O
. O

Dang O
it O
! O

The O
wok B
fried I
string I
beans I
and O
carrot B
cake I
were O
surprisingly O
good O
too O
for O
such O
an O
ordinary O
dish O
. O

It O
was O
a O
disappointing O
experience O
having O
read O
on O
HGW O
that O
the O
food O
was O
not O
bad O
. O

We O
get O
pissed O
off O
and O
be O
the O
last O
time O
we O
patronised O
. O

The O
most O
value O
for O
$ O
are O
the O
big B
paus I
and O
the O
least O
value O
for O
$ O
are O
the O
. O

It O
was O
around O
11.30 O
am O
when O
we O
reached O
. O

I O
also O
really O
love O
the O
old O
time O
ambience O
. O

when O
we O
finally O
got O
a O
table O
, O
clearly O
we O
were O
all O
starving O
so O
maybe O
this O
review O
isnt O
too O
reliable O
. O

However O
the O
misses O
hit O
me O
more O
because O
i O
had O
high O
expectations O
of O
the O
place O
since O
there O
are O
much O
rave O
about O
the O
dim O
sum O
here O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
char B
siew I
bun I
is O
still O
quite O
soft O
and O
fluffy O
, O
the O
juicy O
char O
siew O
captured O
within O
is O
also O
enjoyable O
. O

They O
order O
like O
no O
need O
money O
like O
that O
! O

Extremely O
savory O
with O
a O
strong O

the O

One O
not-so-good O
point O
though O
: O
The O

process O
was O
rather O
slow O

yummy O

He O
came O

to O
study O
in O

5 O
years O
ago O
and O
is O
unbelievably O
polite O
, O
attentive O
and O
affable O
! O

The O
pumpkin O

was O
also O
too O
thick O
and O
chewy O
. O

There O
are O
bits O
of O

but O
i O
don O

see O
the O
point O
in O
paying O

for O
an O
average O
small O
bowl O
porridge O
. O

On O
the O
inside O
, O
the O
mee-suan O
was O
soft O
and O
had O
a O
texture O
similar O
to O
that O
of O
carrot O

it O

my O

heard O
that O

However O
I O
went O
around O
630pm O
on O
a O
Monday O
evening O
and O
towards O
the O
night O
it O
got O
rather O
packed O
. O

I O
rather O
liked O
the O
pan O
fried O
carrot B
cake I
( O
2 O
pieces O
for O
$ O
2 O
) O
that O
had O
the O
right O
chunks O
of O
radish O
and O
dried O
shrimps O
. O

eg O
. O

Our O
hong B
Kong I
noodles I
tasted O
distictly O
like O
soap O
, O
were O
discolored O
and O
cold O
. O

Walked O
in O
exactly O
at O
6pm O
... O

With O
restaurant O
pricing O
I O
guessed O
I O
had O
higher O
expectations O
of O
the O
quality O
of O
dim O
sum O
. O

the O
steamed O
dumplings O
is O
so O
so O
. O

There O
is O
this O
particular O
lady O
( O
she O
should O
some O
lead O
waitress O
of O
sorts O
as O
she O
was O
not O
in O
the O
standard O
uniform O
) O
, O
she O
was O
very O
attentive O
and O
even O
came O
back O
to O
check O
if O
we O
had O
managed O
to O
order O
our O
desserts O
when O
we O
asked O
her O
for O
the O
whereabouts O
of O
the O
desserts O
cart O
. O

If O
not O
everytime O
sure O
head O
down O
to O
which O
is O
rather O
expensive O
. O

Location O
was O
hellishly O
far O
. O

i O
waited O
for O
about O
30 O
minutes O
, O
and O
still O
my O
food O
had O
yet O
to O
come O
, O
depsite O
ordering O
the O
exact O
same O
dish O
. O

i O
had O
to O
approach O
an O
auntie O
by O
the O
counter O
to O
ask O
where O
to O
sit O
. O

What O
was O
believed O
to O
be O
initial O
hype O
surrounding O
the O
then O
nascent O
outlet O
has O
yet O
to O
peter O
out O
. O

Having O
read O
reviews O
of O
customers O

up O
to O
3 O
hours O
to O
try O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan's O
dim O
sum O
at O
their O
first O
outlet O
located O
at O
the O
Plaza O
Singapura O
Extension O
was O
somewhat O
too O
ridiculous O
so O
we O
decided O
to O
visit O
during O
off-peak O
dining O
at O
around O
4pm O
in O
the O
afternoon O
on O
a O
weekday O
. O

For O
quality O
dim O
sum O
in O
an O
exquisite O
setting O
, O
Cherry O
Garden O
is O
your O
best O
bet O
! O

Overall O
, O
the O
food O
quality O
has O
been O
consistently O
good O
, O
made O
on O
the O
spot O
and O
fresh O
and O
my O
relatives O
especially O
like O
the O
prawns O
dumplings O
, O
char B
siew I
bao I
, O
siew B
mai I
. O

Never O
really O
complained O
much O
. O

is O
actually O
dumpling B
in I
chilli I
oil I
not O
too O
bad O
.. O

Although O
the O
queue O
was O
long O
, O
it O
moved O
pretty O
fast O
and O
we O
were O
allocated O
a O
table O
within O
20 O
minutes O
. O

FAILED O
! O

The O
table O
were O
quite O
dirty O
as O
it's O
wooden O
. O

( O
- O
) O
It O
was O
so O
soft O
that O
it O
was O
mashy O
, O
which O
was O
not O
quite O
what O
we O
expected O
. O

Thus O
if O
the O
previous O
customer O
spilled O
something O
, O
it O
would O
seep O
into O
the O
wood O
and O
if O
you O
clean O
it O
with O
a O
damp O
cloth O
. O

Service O
wise O
I O
think O
the O
staffs O
there O
are O
quite O
attentive O
. O

Luckily O
, O
the O
turnover O
is O
quite O
fast O
, O
found O
a O
table O
within O
5minutes O
. O

the O
award-winning O
restaurant O
is O
right O
smack O
in O
the O
heart O
of O
the O
bustling O
Suntec O
/ O
Marina O
Square O
area O
, O
it O
still O
manages O
to O
exclude O
a O
serene O
and O
tranquil O
atmosphere O
. O

The O

didn't O
appear O

as O
stated O
in O

, O
but O
they O
were O
still O
quite O

they O

you O

then O
this O

can O
even O
taste O
piece O
of O

inside O
of O
the O

... O

Most O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
was O
salty O
and O
all O
the O
items O
are O
all O
over-priced O
! O

That O
why O
the O
delay O
of O
our O
drinks O
made O
me O
so O
mad O
angry O
... O

the O
food O
was O
great O
so O
as O
the O
staffs O
. O

When O
the O
food O
came O
too O
fast O
, O
I O
was O
surprised O
. O

Having O
been O
to O
Red O
Star O
when O
i O
was O
young O
many O
many O
years O
back O
, O
i O
was O
relatively O
surprise O
when O
my O
colleagues O
want O
to O
go O
to O
Red O
Star O
for O
our O
farewell O
lunch O
. O

Surprised O
at O
no O
name O
plates O
hanging O
in O
front O
of O
the O
trolley-cart O
and O
every O
one O
has O
to O
crowd O
around O
the O
cart O
and O
even O
open O
the O
steambox O
to O
check O
what O
is O
inside O
. O

The O
food O
is O
not O
as O
flavorful O
and O
not O
as O
fresh O
. O

Now O
you O
ruined O
your O
reputation O
because O
of O
a O
few O
bucks O
. O

Most O
of O
all O
the O
wanton O
noodles O
and O
leong O
tau O
hu O
in O
the O
adjoining O
coffee O
shop O
is O
pretty O
good O
too O
... O

Weird O
combination O
of O
taste O
that O
did O
not O
appeal O
to O
me O
. O

The O
Char B
Siew I
Cheong I

was O
simply O

AND O
wait O
we O
did O

It O
was O
mian O

inside O

interesting O

nonetheless O
thought O
not O
mind-blowing O

. O

All O
the O
waitresses O
have O
attitude O
problems O
. O

As O
others O
mentioned O
, O
services O
and O
ambience O
were O
excellent O
; O
all O
the O
waiting O
staff O
were O
polite O
, O
courteous O
and O
paying O
attention O
to O
each O
table O
. O

it O
was O
like O
eating O
clear O
rice O
paste O
with O
still-rather-solid O
rice O
bits O
( O
i O
grew O
up O
on O

Not O
an O

when O

I O
wanted O

of O
the O

A O
short O
disclaimer O
applies O
here O
as O
I O
didn't O
do O
the O
ordering O
nor O
did O
I O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
set O
menu O
which O
we O
ordered O
, O
hence O
I O
am O
quite O
hazy O
about O
the O
exact O
names O
of O
the O
dishes O
. O

I O
like O
their O
glutinous B
rice I
as O
it O
is O
extremely O
soft O
and O
has O
fully O
absorbed O
the O
fragrance O
of O
the O
lotus O
leaf O
. O

We O
went O
on O
a O
weekend O
. O

Service O
wise O
, O
it O
was O
a O
little O
disappointed O
. O

good O
even O
without O
the O
accompanying O
sauces O
. O

Well O
, O
one O
fine O
day O
, O
Mrupupup O
went O
to O
the O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
store O
to O
eat O
their O
famous O
Dim O
Sum O
dishes O
. O

The O
marinated B
duck I
stuffed I
with I
glutinous I
rice I
is O
like O
char O
siew O
with O
glutinous O
rice O
dumpling O
, O
tastes O
great O
and O
not O
as O
filling O
as O
a O
normal O
rice O
dumpling O
. O

Lucky O
me O
, O
because O
it O
was O
yummy O
. O

I've O
had O
better O
( O
but O
more O
expensive O
ones O
) O
so O
this O
was O
decent O
for O
it's O
price O
. O

My O
kaki O
liked O
this O
dish O
but O
I O
felt O
the O
skin O
a O
tad O
too O
thick O
for O
my O
liking O
. O

The O
other O
hot O
sampler O
was O
a O
scallop B
with I
salted I
egg I
yolk I
which O
I O
personally O
found O
to O
be O
average O
due O
to O
the O
sweetness O
of O
the O
scallop O
being O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
egg O
yolk O
. O

The O
rice O
is O
fragrant O
and O
soft O
, O
giving O
out O
the O
lotus O
leaf O
scent O

In O

will O
describe O
it O

the O
roasted B

was O
a O
tad O
too O

not O
the O
style O

we O
didn't O
really O
enjoy O

Because O
it O
is O
such O
a O
noisy O

and O
that O
all O
the O

very O
busy O

We O

am O
I O
suppose O
to O

The O
food O
is O
savory O
and O
the O
ambiance O
is O
great O
for O
quiet O
Sunday O

with O
the O

With O

perhaps O

add O

How O
hot O
a O
dim O

is O
when O
it O
is O

is O
a O
litmus O
test O
: O

never O

up O
. O

It O
came O
swimming O
in O
a O
pool O
of O
dark O
sauce O
, O
and O
tasted O
more O
like O
a O
pudding O
, O
albeit O
a O
very O
very O
salty O
one O
. O

This O
time O
there O
wasn't O
any O
queue O
as O
i O
was O
there O
on O
a O
weekday O
. O

It O
felt O
more O
like O
a O
Chinese O
New O
Year O
night O
market O
at O
Chinatown O
. O

You O
can O
sit O
in O
the O
air-cond O
area O
or O
behind O
, O
sort O
of O
a O
back O
lane O
. O

the O
place O
is O
sprawling O
, O
and O
it O
is O
testament O
to O
their O
quality O
that O
they O
have O
been O
around O
for O
a O
really O
really O
really O
long O
time O
. O

When O
we O
arrived O
at O
11am O
, O
there O
was O
already O
a O
very O
long O
queue O
which O
i O
felt O
was O
pretty O
common O
since O
it O
was O
well O
known O
for O
its O
dim O
sum O
. O

But O
at O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
, O
they O
chill O
it O
in O
a O
bowl O
of O
ice O
cubes O
which O
I O
believe O
helps O
retain O
the O
original O
flavour O
of O
the O
tea O
better O
. O

While O
I O
was O
in O
Hong O

, O
I O
was O
too O
quick O
to O
throw O
it O
out O
the O
window O
as O
the O
name O
isn O

as O
appealing O
, O
you O
have O
to O
admit O
. O

Once O
you O
get O
a O

, O
you O
may O
have O
to O
carry O
your O

However O
, O
as O
the O
water O
rose O
in O
the O

and O
the O
cup O
getting O
ever O
lighter O
, O
there O
s O
a O
risk O
of O
it O
toppling O
over O
so O
we O
eventually O
removed O
it O
altogether O
. O

Despite O
being O
slightly O
overrated O
, O
I O
must O
say O
some O
of O
the O
dishes O
here O
are O
indeed O
fresher O
and O
tastier O
than O
other O
dim O
sum O
restaurants O
. O

The O
food O
is O
average O
. O

I O
am O
not O
even O
a O
fussy O
person O
. O

Ambience O
: O
For O
a O
relatively O
ghetto O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
dim O
sum O
joint O
, O
it's O
acceptable O
. O

The O
starters O
were O
superb O
, O
main O
dishes O
were O
just O
so O
delicious O
. O

( O
- O
) O
The O
milk B
tea I
was O
not O
fragrant O
, O
rich O
nor O
smooth O
enough O
. O

The O
big O
chunk O
of O
pork O
, O
mushroom O
and O
shrimp O
mixture O
was O
chewy O
, O
delicious O
and O
outstanding O
. O

My O
sch O
is O
just O
opposite O
this O
sunshine O

, O
so O
i O
used O
to O
eat O
this O
very O
often O

Its O
not O
century B
and I
salted I
egg I

. O

Its O
like O
preserved O

? O

Thus O
, O
i O
nicely O
went O
to O
speak O
with O
the O
store-in-charge O
/ O
chef O
/ O
owner O
on O
this O
, O
and O
to O
my O
utter O
shock O
and O
disgust O
, O
he O
replied O
arrogantly O
, O
If O
you O
cant O
wait O
, O
then O
leave O
! O

Well O
, O
more O
like O
a O
small O

than O
a O

We O
waited O
and O
waited O
but O
we O
only O
saw O
her O
doing O

What O
to O
eat O

the O

with O
a O

I O
would O
totally O
return O
just O
for O
this O

Red O

is O
more O
of O
a O
novelty O
as O
you O
have O
the O
traditional O
trolleys O
pushed O
by O
the O

where O
one O
can O
point O

pick O

from O
an O

When O
my O

two O

( O
one O
normal O

one O

, O
the O

said O
in O
a O

and O
don't-bother-me-with-your-piffling-concerns O
manner O
that O
they O
were O
different O
and O
he O
wanted O

: O
It's O
a O
corner O
cafe O
set O
in O
the O
new O
Plaza O
Singapore O

- O
Atrium O
. O

Must O
try O
the O
soup-based O
version O
, O
as O
the O
clear O
soup O
is O
flavoursome O
. O

This O
giant O
of O
a O
wanton O
sneakily O
envelops O
soup O
it O
in O
( O
a O

so O
if O
you're O
the O
kind O
of O
person O
that O
likes O
to O
bite O
your O
wanton O
in O
half O
, O
be O
careful O
or O
the O
dumpling's O
goodness O
is O
going O
to O
spurt O
out O
at O
you O
. O

But O
that O
has O
never O
been O
my O
favorite O
. O

they O
did O
not O
inform O
us O
that O
they O
have O
sold O
out O
their O
prawn B
dumpling I
and O
kept O
us O
waiting O
for O
nothing O
. O

The O
Three O
Varieties O
of O
Dim O
Sum O
was O
a O
very O
nicely O
presented O
dish O
with O
3 O
types O

non O
conventional O
Dim O

. O

Egg B
Tart I
( O
$ O
3.80 O
) O
with O
flakey O
crust O
. O

We O
also O
ordered O
the O
jelly B
fish I
with I
roasted I
pig I
skin I
. O

The O
interior O
is O
filled O
with O
chunks O
of O
char O
siew O
and O
a O
thick O
, O
rich O
sauce O
that O
is O
a O
mixture O
of O
sweet O
and O
savory O
. O

The O
Steam B
Spare I
Ribs I
with I
Black I
Bean I
Sauce I
( O
$ O
3.00 O
) O
again O
is O
a O
must-have O
dish O
although O
, O
those O
chopped O
up O
red O
chili O
just O
spice O
everything O
up O
. O

Try O
the O
Da B
Bao I
, O
it's O
a O
humongous O
pau O
with O
various O
fillings O
like O
sausage O
, O
minced O
meat O
, O
egg O
, O
vegetable O
etc O
and O
probably O
requires O
2 O
to O
finish O
! O

Maybe O
because O
it O
provides O
really O
cheap O
dim O
sum O
- O
but O
at O
mediocre O
quality O
and O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
wasting O
time O
to O
queue O
up O
and O
experiencing O
lousy O
service O
. O

While O
joining O
the O
line O
, O
the O
staff O
kept O
on O
asking O
if O
we O
all O
are O
here O
. O

This O
place O
will O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
this O

No O

I O

Custard I
Bun I
( O
3 O
for O

3.60 O
) O
which O
wasn't O
all O
too O
bad O
. O

But O
we O
still O
could O
not O
understand O
why O
the O
boss O
( O
es O
) O
would O
resort O
to O
hiring O
so O
many O
illegal O
workers O
when O
their O
business O
was O
pretty O
good O
and O
they O
should O
be O
able O
to O
pay O
for O
Singaporean O
workers O
or O

They O
always O
made O
me O
feel O
that O
I O
am O
not O
very O
welcomed O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
am O
not O
regular O
enough O
for O
them O
to O
recognise O
us O
by O

Authentic O

i O
thought O

should O
be O

not O
we O
going O
over O
to O
the O
cart O
and O
order O
, O
if O
we O
were O
to O
go O
over O
and O
order O
, O
its O
like O
in O
a O
food O
court O
, O
or O
they O
might O
as O
well O
change O
it O
to O
a O
buffet O
style O
, O
since O
people O
like O
to O
go O
and O
order O
themselves O
. O

so O
, O
was O
scouting O

for O
a O

As O
for O
the O
food O
, O
there O
were O
hits O
and O
misses O
, O
as O
with O
every O
other O
restaurant O
on O
this O
planet O
. O

Liked O
that O
the O
chunks O
of O
char O
siew O
were O
not O
too O
fat O
and O
its O
oozing O
thick O
sauce O
was O
not O
too O
sweet O
. O

The O
meat O
filling O
was O
a O
little O
hard O
, O
but O
the O
hint O
of O
ginger O
was O
surprising O
. O

Another O
piece O
of O
good O
news O
which O
added O
on O
to O
the O
jollity O
of O
this O
meal O
was O
that O
this O
friend O
of O
mine O
, O
a O
different O
individual O
from O
the O
previous O
regalement O
, O
received O
a O
phone O
call O
that O
informed O
him O
of O
his O
humble O
sweepstake O
winning O
. O

The O
sauce O
ended O
up O
being O
a O
tad O
too O
salty O
, O
but O
hey O
, O
it O
tasted O
great O
anyway O
! O

If O
you O
want O
an O
extra O
serving O
, O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
SGD O
1 O
! O

Only O
the O
xiao B
long I

is O
ok O
, O
quite O
soupy O
. O

One O
lot O
is O
for O
takeaway O
and O
the O
other O
3 O
are O
for O
sit O
down O

Although O
not O
exactly O
the O
traditional O
way O
to O
enjoy O
peking B
duck I
( O
which O
usually O
places O
emphasis O
on O
the O
skin O
) O
, O
I O
enjoyed O
it O
quite O
a O
bit O
thought O
the O
skin O
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
more O
crisp O
. O

Good O
enough O
on O
its O
own O
, O
the O
taste O
was O
accentuated O
when O
dipped O
in O
Worcestershire O
sauce O
. O

One O
small O
issue O
I O
have O
is O
the O
lack O
of O
variety O
in O
this O
place O
. O

seriously O
, O
deal O
with O
it O

The O
newer O
restaurants O
just O
don't O
get O
it O
... O
it's O
all O
about O
the O
sincerity O
of O
the O
people O
... O
man O
... O
when O
will O
these O
people O
ever O
learn O
? O

Inside O
the O
restaurant O
, O
its O
spacious O
and O
roomy O
. O

nothing O
to O
rave O
about O
. O

What O
IS O
great O
is O
the O
ambience O
and O
environment O
. O

For O
the O
slightly O
more O
adventurous O
, O
the O
Vermicelli B
Roll I
with I
Pig's I
Liver I
$ O
5.50 O
is O
certainly O
worth O
a O
try O
. O

Since O
the O
restaurant O
was O
packed O
, O
it O
took O
a O
while O
for O
the O
dim O
sum O
to O
be O
served O
. O

If O
you O
don't O
know O
, O
the O
Hong O
Kong's O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
has O
a O
one O
Michelin O
star O
. O

After O
checking O
with O
the O
counter O
on O
our O
orders O
to O
see O
if O
they've O
missed O
any O
, O
we O
realised O
there O
is O
an O
order O
which O
was O
not O
placed O
by O
us O
. O

Other O
must-tries O
include O
the O
mango B
sago I
with I
pomelo I
, O
pork B
buns I
and O
the O
roasted B
meat I
. O

and O
the O
HAR B
GAOS I
, O
oh O
man O
, O
drool O
inducing O
. O

My O
husband O
loved O
the O
milk B
tea I
there O
- O
said O
it O
was O
like O
those O
in O
HKG O
which O
he O
enjoyed O
when O
we O
used O
to O
live O
there O
. O

Despite O
all O
not O
being O
fans O
of O
Glutinous B
Rice I
, O
we O
all O
absolutely O
loved O
this O
and O
devoured O
it O
in O
no O
time O
. O

They O
truly O
enjoyed O
the O
dinner O
. O

she O
completely O
ignored O
us O
the O
whole O
time O
until O
i O
had O
to O
go O
over O
and O
give O
her O
our O
order O
. O
what O
the O
hell O
, O
really O
. O

these O
buns O
. O

2 O
. O

Should O
never O
order O
the O
water O
! O

Tables O
fill O
up O
quite O
quickly O
during O
lunchtime O
but O
turnover O
is O
also O
pretty O
fast O
, O
facilitated O
by O
bossy O
kitchen O
helpers O
and O
a O
highly O
efficient O
order O
chit O
system O
. O

i O
appreciated O
that O
all O
noodles O
r O
freshly O
pulled O
when O
ordered O
hence O
e O
Qness O
is O
superb O
! O

The O
restaurant's O
decor O
is O
atypical O
of O
a O
traditional O
Hong O
Kong O
Chinese O
restaurant O
- O
red O
metal-cushy O
chairs O
, O
large O
round O
tables O
covered O
with O
white O
tablecloth O
, O
and O
patterned O
red O
carpeting O
. O
It O
provided O
a O
very O
cosy O
and O
heartwarming O
environment O
. O

And O
also O
the O
carrot B
cake I
, O
unlike O
ther O
stalls O
, O
they O
steam O
the O
carrot B
cake I
instead O
of O
frying O
it O
. O

Last O
night O
, O
I O
visited O
Viktor's O
Kitchen O
, O
completely O
forgetting O
I O
had O
a O
poor O
impression O
of O
them O
during O
my O
last O
visit O
a O
few O
months O
before O
. O

My O
parents O
got O
married O
at O
Red O
Star O
so O
that O
place O
holds O
a O
certain O
sentimental O
value O
already O

were O
just O

simply O

I O
would O
attest O
to O
their O
latter O
half O
of O
the O
sentence O
, O
but O
as O
for O
the O
former O
, O
I O
shall O
leave O
it O
to O
one's O
discretion O

From O
its O
regular O

down O

Sigh O

kok O
sen O

would O
do O
better O
for O
these O
2 O
dishes O
. O

Don O
t O
be O
expecting O
any O
good O
service O
( O
well O
they O
don O
t O
charge O
service O
charge O
anyways O
) O
, O
or O
a O
good O

etc O

That O

the O

Before O
we O
could O
get O
our O
seats O
warmed O
, O
the O
food O
was O
streaming O
in O
non-stop O
. O

My O
expectation O
was O
low O
, O
so O
I O
was O
satisfied O
with O
what's O
service-able O
: O
the O
cashier O
asking O
every O
other O
payee O
for O
small O
change O
and O
yes O
, O
the O
grand O
lady O
herself O
meditating O
on O
each O
drink O
she O
served O
over O
the O
counter O
. O

Definitely O
worth O
a O
try O
! O

PLEASE O
do O
not O
bring O
your O
children O
there O
, O
i'm O
sure O
you O
do O
not O
want O
your O
child O
to O
heard O
the O
f O
words O
throughout O
the O
whole O
meal O
. O

Nothing O
to O
complain O
about O
! O

Too O
much O
Carbs O
in O
a O
dish O
. O

It O
felt O
like O
a O
maze O
being O
my O
first O
time O
there O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
. O
It O
is O
located O
at O
the O
HDB O
block O
where O
many O
customers O
are O
from O
the O
HDB O
blocks O
especially O
in O
the O
weekends O
morning O
. O

I O
have O
always O
wanted O
to O
go O
to O
Cherry O
Garden O
. O

so O
we O
were O
pushy O
, O
we O
were O
grabby O
, O
and O
we O
got O
food O
. O

The O
place O
is O
really O
nicely O
decorated O
. O

Not O
impressed O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you O
prefer O
pan-fried B
carrot I
cakes I
, O
like O
me O
perhaps O
you O
wouldn't O
enjoy O
it O
as O
much O
. O

Service O
sucks O
and O
food O
so-so O
. O
I O
went O
with O
my O
family O
on O
Christmas O
day O
to O
test O
their O
famous O
dimsum O
and O
was O
very O
disappointed O
. O

Comfortable O
airconditioned O
and O
prompt O
service O
. O

Victor O

divided O
into O
two O

, O
with O
both O
holding O
a O
maximum O
of O
maybe O
fifteen O

Came O
here O
for O
the O
second O

love O
the O

Please O
do O
not O
feel O
emotional O
or O
distress O
should O
you O
have O
any O
violent O
objections O
. O

The O

are O
good O

Try O

it's O
my O

So O
, O
no O
more O
Victor O

for O
us O
. O

My O
two O
top O
favourites O
... O

It O
was O
very O
Q O
and O
it O
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
. O

Just O
use O
the O
sauce O
on O
the O
table O
. O

Of O
course O
we O
were O
charged O
for O
both O
water O
and O
tea O
which O
was O
a O
little O
crazy O
considering O
water O
is O
$ O

This O
place O
is O
good O
for O
gatherings O
for O
both O
your O
friends O
and O
families O
and O
a O
guarantee O
that O
you O
will O
have O
a O
satisfying O
meal O
Tim O

at O
affordable O
prices O
, O
yet O
in O
air-con O

... O

They O
are O
polite O
, O
ready O
to O
make O
recommendations O
and O
always O
have O
a O
sincere O
smile O
on O
their O
faces O
. O

Overall O
a O
nice O
item O
to O
have O
. O

Overall O
, O
my O
friends O
and O
I O
thought O
our O
experience O
at O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
was O
good O
. O

The O
carrot B
cake I
is O
steamed O
in O
a O
bowl O
with O
topped O
XO O
sauce O
with O
caipoks O
. O

The O
century O

was O
hidden O
at O
the O
bottom O
and O
a O
few O
stirs O
unraveled O
the O
hidden O
treasures O
of O
black O
gold O
beneath O
. O

Small O

papers O
with O
menu O
choices O
were O
available O
on O
the O
table O
. O

Was O
there O
over O
the O
weekend O
. O

Honestly O
, O
this O
didn't O
strike O
me O
as O
being O
an O
unforgettable O
dish O
. O

Instead O
of O
the O
usual O
steamed O
bun O
, O
this O
was O
baked O
, O
giving O
it O
a O
very O
soft O
and O
tender O

The O

it O

:: O
A O
counterpart O
of O
the O
above O
item O
, O
I O
thought O
this O
has O
its O
king O
s O
crown O
on O
it O
deservedly O
. O

The O
skin O
was O
a O
bit O
on O
the O
thick O
side O
but O
was O
not O
too O
much O
of O
a O
bother O
anyway O
The O
dish O
which O
Victor O

Kitchen O
is O
well O
known O
for O
is O
the O
Golden B
Egg I
Yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
( O
$ O
4.00 O
) O
. O

Not O
a O
lot O
of O
shouting O
across O
the O
place O
, O
despite O
it O
being O
somewhat O
of O
an O
old O
school O
yum O
cha O
place O
. O
( O
I O
readily O
stand O
corrected O
if O
I O
made O
a O
wrong O
assumption O
) O

The O
pastry O
is O
buttery O
and O
flaky O
, O
reminding O
you O
of O
the O
calories O
in O
each O
sinful O
bite O
but O
you O
go O
ahead O
and O
finish O
the O
whole O
tart O
anyway O
. O

So O
if O
your O
looking O
for O
a O
supper O
venu O
with O

and O
don't O
feel O
like O
venturing O
to O

The O

Disappointing O

If O
this O

I'd O

of O
how O

Surely O
nothing O

boost O
off O

Good O
place O
for O
dim O
sum O
! O

The O
beef B
brisket I
noodles I
was O
served O
in O
a O
tasty O
soup O
, O
and O
the O
la B
mian I
were O
cooked O
till O
al O
dente O
but O
was O
only O
of O
average O
standard O
in O
general O
. O

The O
taste O
is O
simple O
unique O
and O
fabulous O
. O

it O
was O
super O
fragrant O
! O

Also O
recommended O
is O
their O
snacks O
such O
as O
french B
beans I
with I
shrimps I
, O
fried B
rice I
and O
pork O
cutlet O
la-mian B
. O

The O
beef O
items O
should O
be O
avoided O
because O
it's O
minced O
beef O
mixed O
with O
salty O
flavor O
enhancers O
and O
some O
unidentifiable O
starchy O
substance O
that O
appeared O
gooey O
( O
probably O
some O
food O
stabilizer O
) O
. O

What's O
good O
about O
the O
buffet O
is O
that O
I O
could O
order O
the O
number O
of O
pieces O
of O
dim O

. O

Due O
to O
the O
word O
limit O
, O
please O
see O
my O
entire O

To O
me O
, O
its O
like O
travelling O
down O

where O
my O
family O
used O
to O
head O
out O
for O
Dim O
Sum O
early O
sunday O
morning O
every O
week O
and O
those O
were O
the O
days O
:) O

This O
is O
one O
dish O
that's O
definitely O
the O
highlight O
of O
the O
meal O
for O
me O
. O

I O
was O
highly O
disappointed O
when O
I O
ripped O
open O
the O
bun O
, O
only O
to O
discover O
that O
the O
custard O
filling O
had O
already O
hardened O
( O
like O
egg O
yolk O
) O
. O

The O
famed O
item O
was O
indisputably O
one O
of O
the O
best O
renditions O
in O
Singapore O
, O
with O
its O
molten O
state O
of O
full O
- O
bodied O
Salted O
Egg O
Yolk O
filling O
that O
oozed O
out O
when O
the O

was O
split O
open O
. O

Porridge O
is O
already O
sold O
out O
even O
before O
we O
get O
the O
table O
, O
but O
luckily O
the O
char B
siew I

still O
available O
. O

Im O
just O
astounded O
by O
the O
rave O

here O
and O
I'm O
wondering O
if O
the O
Michelin O
judges O
went O
to O
any O
other O
dim O

restaurant O
. O

we O
didnt O
order O
much O
as O
we O
just O
wanted O
to O
have O
the O
main O

Good O

, O
especially O
the O
Yam B

that O
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
traditional O
Chinese O

. O

Service-wise O
, O
it O
can O
be O
faster O
, O
but O
mayb O
there O
is O
too O
much O
people O
so O
they O
took O
a O
bit O
slower O
. O

The O
dim O

is O
served O
pretty O
fast O
. O

we O
were O

Other O

of O

there O

according O
to O

was O
rather O
strong O

together O

compounded O
the O
fragrance O

piquancy O
of O

The O

a O

I O

And O
when O
we O
complained O
about O
the O
bad O

the O

they O

Sticking O
to O
the O

is O
a O
safer O
bet O
. O

her O
cousin O
agreed O
. O
hmm O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
items O
are O
just O
ordinary O
lacklustre O
stuff O
that O
lack O
the O
variety O
, O
creativity O
and O
depth O
, O
not O
exactly O
what O
I O
expect O
from O
a O
high O
end O
restaurant O
. O

It O
was O
not O
too O
moist O
with O
gravy O
while O
the O
Nameko O
Mushrooms O
went O
really O
well O
with O
the O
noodles O
and O
the O
silver O
sprouts O
brought O
a O
certain O
crunch O
to O
the O
dish O
itself O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
authentic O
dim O
sum O
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O
worth O
a O
visit O
. O

If O
she O
had O
toned O
down O
and O
sounded O
nicely O
, O
I O
would O
consider O
paying O
for O
the O
dish O
even O
if O
I O
am O
not O
taking O
it O
. O

However O
, O
this O
course O
was O
scrumptious O
enough O
with O
the O
sauce O
. O

It O
impossible O
not O
to O
be O
impressed O
by O
the O
decor O
of O
this O
place O
. O

Just O
typing O
this O
makes O
me O
hungry O
for O
these O
juicy O
prawn O
dumpling O
wrapped O
in O
the O
thinnest O
layer O

that O

disappointment O

that O
it's O

a O

To O
get O

I O
certainly O

I O

you O
would O

The O

to O
the O
surprise O
of O
what O
the O

could O
offer O

However O
, O
the O
bulk O
of O
the O
taste O
came O
from O

For O
the O

view O

I'm O
actually O
creating O

For O
something O
light O
and O
spongy O
, O
without O
being O
cloyingly O
sweet O
, O
the O
item O
would O
make O
the O

I O
did O
a O
search O
on O
Victor's O
Flowing O
Custard B
Buns I
$ O

and O
I O
realised O
the O
custard B

here O
is O
not O
always O
that O
flowing O
. O

It O
s O
one O
of O
the O
most O
flavorful O
beancurds O
I O
ve O
had O
. O

I O
always O
love O
Swee O
Choon's O
efficiency O
of O
delivering O
food O
. O

I O
am O
so O
looking O
forward O
to O
going O
there O
to O
try O
the O
yu B

again O
... O

Must O
try O
, O
long O
queue O
during O

. O

However O
, O
the O
Scallop B
and I
spinach I
crystal I
dumpling I
did O
came O
across O
as O
slightly O
dry O
. O

My O
current O
favorite O
is O
the O
rice O
, O
beef O
and O
egg O
in O
a O
tin O
. O

Total O
nightmare O
of O
a O
night O
. O

As O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
I O
really O
think O
they O
re O
good O
but O
not O
that O
outstanding O
, O
because O
Imperial O
Treasure O
delivers O
similar O
standards O
for O
their O
dim O
sum O
, O
just O
without O
the O
annoying O
long O
queues O
. O

no O
ingredients O
of O
chicken O
or O
much O
pieces O
of O
arrowroot O
though O
, O
guess O
you're O
supposed O
to O
enjoy O
the O
deep O
favour O
of O
the O
clear O
soup O
on O
its O
own O
. O

Tonic B
Medlar I

Osmanthus I
Cake I
( O
$ O
3.50+ O
+ O
) O
- O
Looks O
super O
pretty O
in O
photos O
but O
tastes O
way O
to O
herby O
and O
sweet O
for O
me O
:( O

Spare B
Ribs I
rice I
( O
$ O
3 O
) O
I O
m O
not O
even O
sure O
if O
i O
want O
to O
elaborate O
on O
the O
spare B
ribs I
rice I
. O

But O
one O
sentence O
, O
and O
she O
shut O
me O
up O
with O
: O
oke O
oke O
la O
, O
don O
worry O
I O
started O
to O
say O
to O
my O
friends O
in O
front O
of O
her O
, O
let's O
not O
to O
eat O
here O
again O
. O

But O
what O
are O
they O
exactly O
? O

Cheap O
and O
good O
. O

Basically O
you O
just O
have O
to O
exit O
the O
MRT O
station O
and O
walk O
towards O
Jalan O
Besar O
, O
go O
by O
Komala O
and O
continue O
walking O
straight O
till O
you O
reach O
a O
junction O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
Sichuan B
Chili I
Oil I
Wanton I
( O
4 O
for O
$ O
4 O
) O
which O
had O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
spice O
and O
vinegar O
. O

So O
, O
if O
you O
don't O
mind O
paying O
more O
for O
salty O
and O
enjoy O
the O
aunties O
selling O
food O
, O
you O
can O
still O
visit O
Red O
Star O
... O
for O
the O
old O
flavour O
sake O
. O

I O
am O
not O
fan O
of O
Hawkers O
, O
so O
I O
like O
to O
be O
seated O
in O
a O
room O
like O
at O
Victor's O
kitchen O
, O
it O
is O
a O
family O
business O
. O

A O
few O
things O
that O
you O
should O
not O
miss O
here O
: O

And O
mind O
you O
, O
it's O
authentic O
dim O

. O

Soya B
bean I
drink I
was O
adequately O
sweetened O
( O
one O
friend O
said O
it O
was O
a O
bit O
too O
sweet O
) O
but O
diluted O
. O

With O
the O
soft O
opening O
of O
a O
2nd O
branch O
at O
ERA O
Centre O
, O
I O
queued O
only O
15 O
minutes O
at O
[ O

Still O
worth O
queuing O
for O
are O
Steamed B
Egg I

and O
Spring B

Egg I
White I
, O
but O
must-orders O
when O

are O
no O
longer O
just O
its O
Baked B
Bun I
with I
BBQ I
Pork I
and O
Steamed B
Prawn I
Dumplings I
. O

We O
actually O
spent O
less O
than O
$ O
45 O
for O
such O
a O
filling O
and O
yummy O
meal O
. O

have O
to O
say O
that O
their O
food O
is O
fantastic O
. O

Food O
was O
bad O
( O
in O
my O
personal O
view O
) O
and O
service O
was O
the O
worst O
i O
have O
experienced O
. O

You O
are O
always O
welcome O
to O
visit O
ladyironchef O
for O
a O
full-up O
on O
this O
trip O
. O

The O
dim O
sum O
is O
horrible O
and O
the O
plate O
of O
char B
siew I
and O
roasted B
pork I
was O
cold O
and O
tasted O
very O
porky O
. O

What's O
the O
difference O
you O
may O
ask O
? O

And O
Victor O
s O
King B
Prawn I
Dumpling I
$ O
4.50 O
is O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O

about O

Though O
the O
restaurant O
looks O
old O
inside O
, O
i O
still O
like O
the O
ambience O
there O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Red O
Star O
last O
Saturday O
, O
full O
of O
anticipation O
after O
reading O
all O
the O
fantastic O
reviews O
about O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Was O
told O
to O
go O
to O
table O
70 O
. O

I O
only O
have O
one O
word O
to O
describe O
their O
food O
, O
DISAPPOINTMENT O
. O

Anyway O
, O
we O
decided O
to O
risk O
the O
wait O
, O
and O
within O
1 O
minute O
, O
our O
items O
came O
, O
calling O
their O
bluff O
. O

And O
Braised B
Chicken I
Feet I
- O
tender O
chicken B
feet I
with O
almost O
crispy O
skin O
, O
braised O
in O
a O
salted-sweet O
sauce O
that O
was O
very O
lovely O
. O

The O
food O
was O
decent O
, O
with O
a O
fair O
spread O
for O
vegetarians O
, O
but O
I O
would O
not O
find O
myself O
going O
out O
of O
the O
way O
to O
have O
a O
meal O
here O
. O

Value O
: O
I O
had O
expected O
a O
higher O
price O
but O
it's O
reasonable O
and O
within O
the O
pricing O
of O
most O
dim O
sum O
outlets O
in O
Singaproe O
, O
in O
spite O
of O
the O
fame O
. O

The O
crust O
of O
the O
egg B
tarts I
were O
also O
crispy O
and O
tasted O
awesome O
! O

The O
dumpling O
skin O
was O
thin O
and O
the O
prawns O
inside O
were O
fat O
and O
juicy O
. O

Wala B
porridge I
was O
no O
good O
. O

The O
Queen O
Size O
Siew B
Mai I
( O
$ O
4 O
) O
came O
in O
a O
basket O
of O
4 O
. O

Rarely O
did O
i O
see O
any O
dumpling O
outside O
( O
except O
from O
my O
mom O
s O
home-made O
dumpling O
) O
that O
has O
fillings O
so O
thick O
the O
dumpling O
skin O
barely O
hold O
it O
. O

So O
if O
you O
are O
planning O
your O
time O
, O
you O
might O
wanna O
either O
come O
early O
or O
have O
someone O
in O
your O
family O
to O

up O

my O

I O

much O
that O
we O

it O

the O

not O
the O
Siew B

that O
I O

The O
interior O

brightly-lit O
with O
a O
very O
open O

filled O

happily O

over O

. O

This O
was O
my O
second O
time O
at O
Red O

We O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
other O
table O
was O
too O
compact O
to O
squeeze O
in O
another O
two O

but O
she O
insisted O
There O
is O
only O
the O

of O
you O

this O
is O

i O

the O
one O

it O

Sometimes O
need O
to O
bring O
card O
and O
approach O
the O
push O

cos O
it O
will O
take O
sometime O
to O
reach O
your O

there O
are O
many O
customers O

Despite O
having O
just O
ample O
space O
for O
all O
necessary O
movements O
and O
tools O
for O
business O
, O
let O
me O
just O
say O
that O
the O
real O
treasures O
are O
all O
definitely O
hidden O
within O
! O

hmmm O

a O
very O
simple O
dish O

it O
was O
satisfying O

since O
we O
were O
so O
hungry O

Very O
yummy O
! O

Cantonese O
congee O
is O
always O
smooth O
and O
creamy O
unlike O
their O
Teochew O
counterparts O
and O
that O
is O
how O
I O
like O
my O
congee O
. O

Once O
, O
she O
got O
away O
from O
our O
table O
, O
she O
had O
totally O
forgotten O
about O
the O
chair O
. O

It's O
really O
popular O
as O
evidenced O
by O
the O
ridiculously O
long O
queues O
on O
sunday O
. O

Being O
first-timers O
, O
we O
ordered O
from O
the O
list O
of O
Hong O
Kong-style O
items O
. O

Food O
is O
always O
consistently O
good O
, O
service O
is O
very O
fast O
with O
the O
wait O
staff O
being O
very O
attentive O
even O
when O
they're O
often O
having O
to O
multi-task O
, O
with O
several O
tables O
calling O
for O
their O
attention O

and O
a O
long O

Many O
locals O
visit O
this O
is O
the O
place O
! O

The O
place O
is O
pretty O
cramped O
, O
plus O
the O
cantonese O
music O
blaring O
in O
the O
background O
, O
the O
Hong O
Kong O
feel O
is O
really O
strong O
. O

I O
am O
very O
disappointed O
too O
. O

It O
was O
true O
before O
but O
I O
might O
not O
recommend O
this O
place O
again O
. O

The O
signature O
and O
best O
item O
was O
the O
golden B
egg I
yolk I
lava I
bun I
. O

The O
Silky B
Custard I
Bun I
! O

In O
fact O
, O
we O
had O
eaten O
here O
almost O
10 O
years O
ago O
and O
we O
did O
remember O
it O
to O
be O
rather O
pricey O
, O
so O
I O
guess O
some O
things O
just O
don't O
change O
. O

Also O
serves O
other O
delightful O
items O
like O
the O
cold O
pork B
knuckle I
and O
deep B
fried I
shishamo I
. O

when O
it O
was O
first O
served O
, O
i O
questioned O
the O
rationale O
of O
an O
atas O
restaurant O
serving O
something O
that O
looked O
as O
though O
you O
could O
buy O
it O
off O
a O
western O
hawker O
stall O
for O
possibly O
1/4 O
of O
the O
price O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
restaurant O
does O
not O
accept O
Capitaland O
Mall O
vouchers O
as O
it O
claims O
that O
it's O
still O
new O
and O
has O
just O
opened O
. O

We O
left O
without O
finishing O
our O
food O
. O

But O
Dim O
Joy's O
century O
egg O
porridge O
also O
costs O
$ O
9 O
( O
to O
be O
fair O
, O
it O
comes O
in O
a O
pot O
with O
generous O
bits O
of O
pork O
and O
century O
egg O
, O
and O
can O

! O

So O
it's O
bullshit O
saying O
that O
cheap O
food O
comes O
without O
friendly O
services O
. O

The O
table O
was O
cleaned O
and O
set O
up O

15 O
mins O

Also O
, O
it O
helps O

no O
good O
just O
sitting O
on O
your O
table O
waiting O
for O
them O
to O
come O
, O
people O
were O
literally O
walking O
up O
to O
the O

, O
grabbing O
food O
, O
and O
getting O
their O

One O
little O
gripe O
i O
might O
have O
if O
i O
were O
picky O
would O
be O
that O
the O
filling O
was O
slightly O
little O
. O

Although O
we O
had O
not O
bite O
into O
the O
famous O
golden B
lava I
bun I
, O
saving O
the O
best O
for O
the O
last O
, O
we O
call O
for O
the O

and O
left O
. O

Dim O
sum O
seems O
to O
dominate O
my O
thoughts O
these O
days O

As O
I O
did O
not O

together O
with O
my O

it O
became O
a O
hilarious O

for O

you O

When O
I O

I O

I O

quite O
run-down O

The O

since O
we O
had O
quite O
a O
time O
deciding O
what O
we O
want O
& O
how O
much O
to O
consume O
. O

But O
after O
being O
ill-treated O
and O
scolded O
and O
shouted O
, O
I O
decided O
not O
to O
have O
it O
and O
insisted O
that O
they O
cancelled O
it O
and O
took O
it O
off O
from O
the O
charges O

still O

It O
really O
brought O
out O
the O

of O
a O

This O
is O
a O

do O
not O
think O
that O
because O
it O
is O
only O

it O
will O
be O

This O
place O
has O
yet O
to O
fail O
me O
with O
their O
consistency O
in O
taste O
and O
presentation O
that O
is O

The O
rice O
is O
so O
fragrant O

soft O

and O
I O
simply O
find O
the O
ingredients O
irresistible O
from O
the O
tender O
chicken O

, O
to O
the O
Chinese O

, O
to O
the O

much O
as O
u O
can O
.. O

They O
currently O
do O
not O
have O
any O
take O

so O
you O
can O
order O
your O
extra O

they O

you O
to O

There O
was O
also O
a O
nostalgic O
feeling O

at O
a O
place O
that O
serves O
dim O

in O

are O
cold O

so O
so O

1st O

last O

disappointed O
, O
not O
worth O
travel O
all O
the O
way O
here O
. O

We O
know O
it's O
late O
maybe O
they O
want O
to O
prep O
for O
the O

I'm O
sure O
this O
bao O
doesn't O
need O
more O
introduction O

When O
we O
arrive O
, O
there O
were O
a O
short O
queue O
waiting O
for O

, O
but O
we O
were O
quickly O
seated O
in O
less O
than O
5 O
minutes O

I O
really O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
this O
is O
. O

I O
prefer O
this O

version O
much O
much O
more O
(: O

What O
horrible O
service O

the O
food O
wasn't O
especially O
great O
too O

that O
it O
isn't O
a O
dying O
memory O
but O
one O
still O
very O
much O
alive O
. O

Wonderful O
! O

The O
rational O
is O
to O
not O
let O
the O
ice O
melt O
in O
it O
to O
alter O
the O
taste O
of O
the O
tea O

just O

not O
too O
sweet O

the O

The O
main O
reason O
we O
came O
was O
because O
we O
expected O
a O
good O
dim O

spot O
but O
we O
were O
sad O
to O
say O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
fell O
short O
of O
our O
expectations O

It O
is O
a O

popular O
with O
the O
older O

, O
having O
been O
around O
for O
quite O
sometime O

it's O

Food O
is O

is O

Do O
try O
out O
their O
crispy O
wasabi-aioli B

with O
fresh O

We O
intermittently O
stopped O

to O
request O
our O
food O
. O

Halfway O
through O
the O
meal O
, O
in O
the O
distance O

we O
heard O
a O
loud O

I O
personally O
like O
the O
Century B
Egg I
porridge I
which O
comes O
with O
lots O
of O
slices O
of O
century O
eggs O
in O
it O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
if O
you O
want O
a O
taste O
of O
traditional O
dim O
sum O
in O
a O
vintage O
place O
, O
go O
for O
it O
! O

Too O
bad O
for O
my O
taste O
buds O
but O
luckily O
for O
my O
weight O
, O
this O
was O
the O
last O
course O
of O
the O
meal O
. O

Had O
some O
takeaway O
from O
Victor's O
kitchen O
since O
I O
happened O
to O
be O
in O
the O
vicinity O
and O
I O
had O
rather O
fond O
memories O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
. O

Heard O
similar O
complains O
from O
other O
customers O
. O

Don't O
be O
fooled O
by O
its O
appearances O
. O

The O
sweet O
pink O
drunken B
chicken I
dumpling I
offers O
a O
generous O
juicy O
bits O
of O
chicken O
with O
hints O
of O
ginger O
and O
sesame O
oil O
that O
emits O
a O
lingering O
flavour O
in O
the O
mouth O
. O

These O
were O
so O
good O
that O
we O
had O
to O
go O
back O
for O
more O
cause O
no O
one O
in O
the O
group O
of O
6 O
( O
of O
us O
) O
wanted O
to O
share O
our O
roll O
. O
Ha O
! O

I O
think O
you O
can O
skip O
this O
dish O
and O
try O
other O
desserts O
instead O
. O

victor O
is O
very O
generous O
with O
his O
ingredients O
and O
most O
of O
his O
dim O
sums O
contain O
prawns O
. O

Tick O
whatever O
you O
like O
and O
place O
your O
order O
at O
the O
cashier O
. O

This O
age-old O
, O
authentic O
dimsum O
restaurant O
was O
always O
filled O
with O
patrons O
, O
but O
I O
was O
prepared O
to O
wait O
. O

Finally O
the O
queues O
at O
the O
Plaza O
Singapura O
outlet O
had O
shrunk O
. O

Though O
it O
could O
probably O
be O
taken O
as O
a O
dessert O
as O
well O
, O
with O
its O
subtle O
sweet O
notes O
and O
spongy O
texture O
, O
the O
simplicity O
and O
lightness O
of O
this O
traditional O
dim O
sum O
delight O
was O
what O
won O
me O
over O
. O

It O
is O
abit O
salty O
, O
good O
for O
those O
who O
prefer O
their O
food O
to O
be O
more O
heavily O
flavored O

The O

The O

They O
probably O

the O

quite O
the O

The O
down O

that O

What O
I O
really O
love O
about O
the O
soup O
was O
that O
it O
didn O
t O
feel O
like O
any O
commercialized O
soup O
, O
with O
an O
excessive O
usage O
of O
oil O
. O

this O
place O
was O
recommended O
by O
a O
friend O
. O

Glad O
this O
place O
still O
exists O
after O
50 O
years O
! O

It O
is O
actually O
4 O
different O
dishes O
that O
categorize O
under O
a O
theme O
. O

Round O
1 O

congee I
- O
smooth O
congee O
, O
just O
the O
way O
i O
like O
century B
egg I
congee I
to O
be O
. O

The O
skin O
was O
very O
thick O
and O
starchy O
as O
well O
. O

Not O
entirely O
sure O
, O
so O
not O
much O
fuss O
. O

On O
weekdays O
, O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
retirees O
reading O
papers O
while O
enjoying O
a O
nice O
cup O
of O
tea O
. O

As O
for O
siew B
mai I
, O
my O
husband O
compared O
it O
to O
any O
neighbourhood O
hawker O
centre's O
siew B
mai I
. O

I O
suspect O
it O
to O
be O
the O
water O
quality O
. O

Located O
directly O
opposite O
Manhattan O
House O
, O
this O
is O
a O
place O
you O
shouldn't O
miss O
! O

Soft O
and O
silky O
, O
with O
fresh O
prawns O
. O

Had O
Mango B
with I
Pomelo I
& I
Sago I
for O
dessert O
as O
it O
was O
refreshing O
. O

Maybe O
for O
the O
novelty O
if O
friends O
from O
out O
of O
town O
would O
like O
some O
dim O
sum O
, O
but O
not O
for O
the O
dim O
sum O
itself O
. O

So O
if O
you O
would O
like O
slight O
above O
average O
food O
, O
with O
wonderful O
ambiance O
... O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
dimsum O
were O
also O
good O
but O
nothing O
as O
impressive O
as O
the O
buns O
. O

We O
ordered O
1 O
) O
Oven-Baked B
Spring I
Chicken I
in I
Barbecue I
Garlic I
Sauce I
( O
$ O
22 O
) O
moist O
and O
juicy O
, O
with O
incredibly O
crisp O
skin O
. O

Firstly O
we O
had O
to O
queue O
for O
a O
table O
. O

let's O
start O
with O
the O
good O
points O
: O
it O
is O
an O
old O
place O
which O
people O
may O
mistake O
for O
quaint O
. O
not O
true O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
felt O
that O
the O
sauce O
was O
lacking O
in O
depth O
as O
the O
saltiness O
was O
too O
overpowering O
. O

So O
if O
you O
do O
go O
, O
make O
sure O
never O
to O
order O
the O
still O
or O
sparkling O
water O
unless O
you O
want O
to O
pay O
16 O
per O
bottle O
. O

the O
broccoli O
was O
very O
good O
. O

If O
you O
need O
a O
refill O
for O
your O
pot O
of O
tea O
, O
just O
tilt O
the O
lid O
a O
little O
& O
* O
whoosh O
* O
it's O
gone O
& O
back O
in O
mere O
minutes O
without O
asking O
! O

Service O
was O
very O
prompt O
and O
good O
here O
! O

No O
takeaways O
are O
allowed O
at O
the O
moment O
and O
its O
SMS O
system O
has O
yet O
to O
start O
, O
so O
be O
prepared O
to O
queue O
for O
1-3 O
hours O
. O

Many O
people O
like O
me O
, O
reached O
around O
550pm O
and O
started O
hanging O
outside O
Swee O
Choon O
. O

Overall O
, O
the O
food O
is O
not O
that O
wow O
type O
. O

Firstly O
they O
serve O
too O
fast O
. O

The O
cheong O
fun O
is O
slightly O
on O
the O
thicker O
side O
compare O
to O
common O
cheong O
fun O
, O
but O
it O
is O
to O
my O
preference O
. O

The O
xiao B
long I
bao I
was O
tasty O
and O
has O
a O
good O
amount O
of O
soup O
in O
it O
. O

Perhaps O
it's O
the O
time O
that O
we O
went O
. O

I O
wanted O
to O
take O
away O
some O
Bo O
lo O
baos O
for O
Melissa O
, O
and O
when O
asked O
, O
the O
staff O
told O
us O
that O
the O
take O
away O
counter O
was O
closed O
, O
understandably O
because O
of O
huge O
demand O
in O
the O
restaurant O
itself O
. O

Thirdly O
, O
they O
are O
charging O
restaurant O
prices O
. O

But O
it O
was O
cod O
alright O
, O
boasting O
a O
velvety O
and O
naturally O
sweet O
flesh O
accentuated O
only O
by O
the O
honey O
marinate O
and O
the O
mildly O
peppery O
and O
aromatic O
black O
pepper O
sauce O
. O

If O
you O
are O
planning O
to O
be O
an O
early O
bird O
and O
be O
there O
when O
the O
place O
opens O
for O
operations O
, O
do O
take O
note O
that O
the O
place O
opens O
officially O
at O
630 O
( O
or O
maybe O
6pm O
if O
I O
remember O
wrongly O
) O
so O
do O
adjust O
your O
timing O
and O
schedule O
accordingly O
. O

Besides O
, O
there O
is O
no O
cover O
for O
the O
chili O
sauce O
container O
, O
and O
perhaps O
best O
left O
alone O
. O

In O
all O
, O
we O
ordered O
about O
7 O
dishes O
and O
they O
are O
: O
a O
) O

Siew I
Bao I
- O
I O
didn't O
get O
to O
try O
this O
because O
there O
were O
3 O
of O
us O
and O
only O
2 O
paus O
per O
serving O
but O
my O
friends O
said O
they O
were O
decent O
. O

We O
managed O
to O
find O
a O
lot O
and O
a O
seat O
in O
about O
30 O
mins O
, O
and O
started O
ordering O
. O

Simple O
but O
tasty O
with O
sesameoil O
that's O
good O
for O
you O
. O

After O
ordering O
a O
mind-boggling O
assortment O
of O
dim O
sum O
, O
we O
only O
ended O
up O
paying O
25 O
dollars O

waive O

what O

off O

this O
might O
look O
a O
little O
schizo O
if O
you O
saw O
the O

that's O
because O
our O

is O
maintained O
by O
two O
people O

and O
I O
wanted O
to O
give O
an O
alternative O
perspective O
on O
the O
food O
here O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
best O
baked O
bun O
I O
ever O
ate O
in O
my O
entire O
life O
. O

Which O
is O
what O
I O
am O
reviewing O
here O
. O

Dim O
sum O
not O
up O
to O
expectation O
, O
since O
I O
was O
told O
that O
the O
dim O

is O
very O
nice O
. O

The O

a O
little O
dissapointing O
... O

Hiring O
illegal O
workers O
in O
place O
of O
local O
workers O
is O
one O
of O
the O
reason O
why O
the O
wages O
in O
this O
industry O
are O
depressed O
for O
our O
local O
workers O
. O

Can't O
remember O
but O
somewhere O
that O
range O
. O

you O
do O
not O
find O
many O
dim O
sum O
places O
left O
where O
they O
push O
the O
carts O
around O
and O
you O
just O
stop O
any O
waiter O
/ O
waitress O
and O
point O
to O
what O
you O
want O
. O

Its O
crumbly O
yet O
fluffy O
dough O

encrusting O
oozy O

flavourful O
barbecued O

has O
won O
the O

of O

it O

I O
would O
prefer O
to O
go O
on O
weekdays O
as O
weekends O
can O
get O
pretty O
crowded O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
to O
have O
lunch O
here O
on O
weekends O
or O
PH O
, O
be O
there O
early O
to O
avoid O

Seriously O
, O
for O
the O
prices O
you O
pay O
, O
you O
can O
enjoy O
yourself O
at O
those O
well-known O
dim O

restaurants O
that O
serve O
better O
quality O
food O
, O
provide O
you O
better O
customer O
service O
and O
you O
dine O
in O
a O
condusive O
environment O
. O

I O
have O
my O
doubts O
on O
paying O
that O
much O
for O
what O
I O

expect O
service O
in O
this O
place O
as O
its O
run O
by O
typical O
Hongkis O
so O
no O
customer O
service O

The O
pork B

was O
so O
light O
and O
crunchy O

and O
the O

alot O
of O
good O
comments O
of O
Tim O

from O
alot O
of O
people O
posting O
on O

so O
thought O
of O
trying O
for O
the O
very O
first O
time O
. O

Overall O
, O
this O
is O
a O
good O
place O
to O
get O
your O
fix O
for O

. O

Imagine O
waiting O
for O
more O
than O
2 O
hours O
for O
a O
table O
that O
is O
so O
small O
and O
the O
seating O
arrangement O
all O
so O
cramped O
. O

Would O
say O
their O
service O
isn't O
up O
to O
mark O
for O
anywhere O
. O

When O
I O
questioned O
the O
waitress O
why O
she's O
trying O
to O
place O
more O
food O
on O
my O
table O
when O
it's O
full O
, O
she O
simply O
replied O
We O
are O

on O
a O
Friday O
afternoon O
, O
the O

took O
me O
about O
2hours O
to O
get O
in O
. O

I O
found O
the O
skin O
a O
bit O
too O
thick O
, O
which O
made O
it O
hard O
to O
enjoy O
the O
soup O

This O
is O
our O
regular O
weekend O
dimsum O
place O
for O
the O
family O
after O
a O
morning O
exercise O
session O
at O

Unlike O
most O
other O
dim O

restaurants O
, O
Swee O
Choon's O
operating O
hours O
are O
from O
6pm O
to O
6am O
catering O
ensuring O
that O
Singaporeans O
have O
an O
extra O
option O
for O
supper O
and O
are O
well-fed O
throughout O
the O
night O
. O

This O
time O
, O
I O
realised O
that O
they O
added O
new O
items O
to O
the O
menu O
! O

For O
the O
same O
price O
at O
Crystal O

dim O

, O
I O
can O
enjoy O
quality O
food O
and O
service O
and O
feel O
full O

Have O
a O
try O
yourself O
and O
share O
with O
us O
what O
you O
feel O
about O
this O
new O
dim O
sum O
place O
! O

the O
servers O
seem O
to O
be O
mostly O
from O
china O
, O
and O
are O
pretty O
professional O
- O
- O
one O
server O
accidentally O
spilled O
a O
dollop O
of O
tea O
on O
my O
tablecloth O
and O
insisted O
on O
changing O
a O
fresh O
one O
for O
me O
. O

I O
was O
in O
Plaza O
Singapura O
around O
6 O
, O
and O
I O
saw O
the O
line O
at O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
was O
short O
, O
so O
I O
joined O
in O
. O

Perhaps O
my O
taste O
buds O
are O
too O
simple O
, O
but O
the O
thick O
, O
heavy O
cartilage-laden O
soup O
was O
not O
to O
my O
liking O
. O

( O
swee O
choon O

$ O

) O
- O
this O
signature O
dim O
sum O
was O
delectable O
. O

In O
this O
visit O
, O
it O
fell O
to O
below O
average O
. O

Can O
taste O
MSG O
in O
some O
dishes O
. O

We O
tried O
a O
lot O
of O
dishes O
and O
each O
one O
was O
better O
than O
the O
other O
, O
my O
singaporean O
wife O
was O
as O
pleased O
as O
I O
was O
. O

The O
line O
is O
to O
be O
expected O
as O
the O
food O
here O
is O
great O
and O
the O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
and O
worth O
for O
money O
. O

we O
asked O
for O
Rice O
inbetween O
dishes O
to O
feed O
our O
hungry O
5 O
year O
old O
. O

The O
dumplings O
have O

in O
it O
which O
shocked O
me O
when O
I O
took O
a O
bite O
. O

nice O

taste O
not O
much O
better O
than O
other O
more O
respectable O

like O
imperial O

which O
serves O
the O
same O
product O
, O
better O
service O
, O
same O
price O
point O

It O
makes O
one O
feel O
welcomed O
, O
doesn't O
it O
? O

But O
there's O
no O
harm O
in O
trying O

the O

the O

of O
Tim O

, O
I O
will O
never O
go O
and O
try O
out O
the O
food O
there O
. O

The O
other O
laudable O
mention O
is O
the O
Chicken B
and I
Sausage I
in I
Glutinous I
Rice I
. O

Dim O
Sum O
which O
was O
usually O
associated O
with O
yum O
cha O
( O
drinking O
of O
tea O
) O
originated O
in O
the O
days O
of O
the O
Silk O
Road O
. O

First O
and O
last O
time O
there O
! O

Nice O
juicy O
prawns O
wrapped O
in O
thin O
skin O
. O

We O
had O
some O
roast B
pork I
as O
a O
starter O
. O

There O
is O
an O
aircon O
section O
and O
outdoor O
section O
for O
smokers O
. O

First O
time O
tasting O
carrot B
cake I
with I
XO I
sauce I
, O
and O
it O
was O
a O
good O
alternative O
to O
the O
fried O
version O
. O

Imagine O
. O

The O
accompanying O
salad O
of O
duck O
and O
jellyfish O
was O
pretty O
nice O
as O
well O
; O
Firm O
slivers O
of O
duck O
coupled O
with O
the O
crunchiness O
of O
jellyfish O
. O

It O
would O
have O
been O
better O
if O
each O
of O
us O
could O
have O
gotten O
something O
more O
substantial O
in O
size O
though O
. O

I O
cant O
really O
remember O
any O
food O
there O
that O
is O
worth O
going O
back O
other O
then O
the O
bean B
curd I
skin I
roll I
and O
spring B
roll I
with I
egg I
white I
. O

I'm O
really O
surprised O
at O
the O
long O
queue O
( O
wondering O
) O
since O
the O
food O
( O
maybe O
to O
me O
) O
was O
just O
mediocre O
at O
best O
. O

We O
also O
loved O
that O
they O
do O
not O
scrimp O
on O
the O
sauce O
; O
something O
that O
other O
restaurants O
do O
so O
often O
now O
which O
makes O
the O
dish O
pales O
in O
comparison O
. O

The O
cart O
pushers O
do O
not O
shout O
out O
the O
items O
they O
are O
pushing O
. O

not O
too O
overpowering O
. O

To O
me O
, O
it O
has O
just O
transformed O
into O
another O
pretentious O
Dim O
Sum O
Restaurant O
. O

It O
s O
like O
doing O
a O
mini O
treasure O
hunt O
and O
some O
people O
may O
like O
that O
. O

for O
a O
supposedly O
high O
class O
setting O
, O
it O
may O
seem O
like O
a O
redundant O
questions O
to O
regulars O
but O
first O
timers O
will O
be O
left O
loitering O
aimlessly O
by O
the O
door O
, O
unsure O
of O
how O
to O
proceeed O
. O

It O
was O
only O
a O
week O
ago O
that O
I O
finally O
paid O
a O
visit O
with O
my O
family O
to O
Cherry O
Garden O
to O
celebrate O
my O
Mum's O
birthday O
. O

Buns O
are O
dry O
& O
flaky O
. O

Freshly O
deep-fried O
crunchy O
skin O
with O
springy O
minced O
prawns O
within O
. O

Their O
vermicelli O
rolls O
are O
served O
plain O
with O
the O
highlight O
, O
but O
soya O
sauce O
will O
be O
poured O
upon O
served O
to O
your O
table O
. O

Their O
style O
is O
more O
of O
fine O
dining O
, O
that O
they O
focus O
on O
the O
good O
taste O
of O
food O
and O
also O
the O
beautiful O
outlook O
of O
the O
food O
. O

we O
reached O
there O
around O
1130am O
to O
avoid O
the O
crowded O
. O

My O
favourite O
would O
have O
to O
be O
their O
steamed B
radish I
cake I
. O

Moreover O
the O
skins O
of O
the O
dumplings O
are O
really O
thick O
, O
obviously O
so O
when O
the O
dumplings O
have O
cooled O
down O
a O
little O
. O

If O
you O
still O
want O
to O
try O
what O
is O
lousy O
food O
and O
poor O
customer O
service O
, O
remember O
to O
take O
a O
photo O
of O
your O
order O
form O
before O
you O
hand O
it O
in O
. O

Must O
try O
! O

Carrot B

good O

it O
unbelievable O

- O
this O
obligatory O
dim O

enjoyable O
with O
soft O
buns O
that O
yielded O
a O
molten O
filling O
which O
was O
a O
mix O
of O
sweet O
and O
savory O
. O

The O
service O
is O
spectecular O
as O
well O
. O

For O
pictures O
and O
a O
full O
review O

scoot O
over O
to O

Very O
disappointing O
. O

At O
least O
on O
your O
first O
visit O
, O
at O
least O
they O
will O
say O
hi O
, O
ask O
you O
to O
take O
a O
seat O

The O

excellent O
. O

only O
after O

turned O
back O
and O
waved O
at O
me O
did O
i O
follow O
her O
. O

Sad O
to O
say O
, O
those O
might O
be O
days O
bygone O
if O
my O
recent O
experience O
is O
indicative O
. O

Don't O
get O
the O
scallop O
mousse O
though O
, O
basically O
they O
put O
a O
proper O
scallop O
under O
the O
grinder O
and O
then O
reassembled O
it O
into O
a O
scallop-shaped O
patty O

in O
the O

Tim O

in O

has O
earned O
a O
reputation O
for O
serving O
up O
quality O
dim O
sum O
that O
are O
made-to-order O
with O
an O
extremely O
affordable O
price O
tag O
, O
but O
not O
without O
first O
braving O
the O
long O
queues O
that O
start O
even O
before O
the O
restaurant O
itself O
opens O
. O

Our O
first O
serving O
came O
with O
human O
hair O
which O
upon O
confirmation O
with O
the O
staff O
, O
not O
part O
of O
the O
plan O
, O
we O
got O
a O
replacement O
. O

And O
the O
real O
disappointment O
is O
the O
dessert O
, O
apart O
from O
the O

that O
we O
have O
ordered O

failed O
to O
rise O

the O

which O
has O
uneven O

thus O
diluting O
the O
taste O

the O

as O
a O
whole O
, O
and O
honestly O
, O
doesn't O
taste O
like O

with O

out O
immense O
subtle O

and O

Imagine O
doing O
this O
the O
whole O
time O
.. O
it O
is O
freaking O
annoying O
. O

Ever O
since O
business O
bloomed O
due O
to O
the O
word O
of O
mouth O
, O
this O
humble O
looking O
eatery O
had O
expanded O
from O
one O
stall O
to O
three O
scattered O
stalls O
around O
the O
ground O
level O
of O
Sunshine O
Plaza O
. O

feels O
like O
going O
to O
hong O
kong O
, O
with O
the O
aunties O
speaking O
in O
cantonese O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
good O
enough O
to O
quench O
our O
thirst O
and O
to O
cool O
the O
tongue O
after O
a O
bout O
of O
hot O
chili O
sauce O
. O

The O
chicken O
was O
tender O
and O
fragrant O
having O
been O
soaked O
and O
steam O
in O
the O
chinese O
wine O
. O

It O
was O
perfectly O
cooked O
and O
glazed O
by O
the O
chicken's O
sauce O
, O
and O
simply O
disgusting O
. O

Lastly O
serving O
was O
way O
too O
slow O
, O
we O
entered O
at O

as O
the O
1st O
customer O
and O
left O
at O
almost O
9pm O

which O
I O
thought O
was O
pretty O
pricey O
considering O
that O
it O
taste O
quite O
like O
normal O
dim O
sum O
. O

It's O
either O
too O
much O
salt O
or O
MSG O
added O
in O
the O
food O
. O

There O
were O
10 O

The O
overall O
service O
is O
good O
, O
although O
if O
you O
arrive O
too O
late O
, O
you O
may O
find O
many O
of O
the O
dishes O
have O
been O
sold O
out O

We O
recommend O
that O
you O
order O
sparingly O
as O
we O
ordered O
too O
much O
for O
the O
2 O
of O
us O
. O

Overall O
, O
i O
would O
say O
at O
least O
, O
you O
should O
try O
this O
place O
once O
. O

With O
the O
cup O
cleverly O
immersed O
in O
a O

of O
ice O
cubes O
, O
the O

remained O
cool O
and O

till O
the O

and O
it O
wasn O

too O
sweet O

This O
was O

a O
piece O

It O
is O
no O

I O
think O

Not O

where O
the O
people O
from O
behind O
the O

already O
eating O
halfway O
thru O

A O
definite O
must O
try O
item O
. O

I O
remember O
doing O
so O
once O
at O
Red O
Star O
Restaurant O
, O
so O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
what O
was O
the O
fuss O
about O
queuing O
for O
another O
dim O
sum O
restaurant O
. O

Two O
issues O
of O
contention O
that O
I O
just O
have O
to O
share O
with O
you O
guys O
before O
you O
all O
plan O
to O
brave O
a O
trip O
down O
within O
the O
next O
few O
weeks O
of O
its O
opening O
! O

But O
then O
again O
much O
of O
the O
damage O
was O
from O
the O
duck O
. O

The O

Amuse O

- O
Honestly O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
serving O
an O
amuse O
bouche O
in O
a O
Chinese O
restaurant O
in O
Singapore O
is O
still O
relatively O
new O
and O
very O
few O
Chinese O
restaurants O
actually O
practice O
that O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
Dim O

for O
this O
small O
establishment O
is O
exceptional O

Not O
great O
dim O
sum O
in O
general O
apart O
from O
a O
few O
dishes O
that O
are O
well O
made O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
it O
wasn't O
too O
oily O
and O
the O
filling O
was O
goooodd O
:) O

Overall O
a O
nice O
experience O
. O

After O
another O
15mins O
of O
waiting O
finally O
tried O
to O
clarify O
the O
orders O
and O
the O
staff O
told O
us O
that O
our O
orders O
got O
delivered O
to O
the O
wrong O
tables O
. O

The O
food O
, O
however O
, O
did O
not O
meet O
our O
expectations O
AT O
ALL O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
you O
will O
find O
tourists O
among O
the O
crowd O
, O
and O
simply O
this O
tells O
you O
how O
good O
the O
food O
is O
! O

Or O
maybe O
just O
that O
all O
dim O
sums O
end O
up O
tasting O
the O
same O
since O
it's O
flour O
dough O
& O
mainly O
prawn O
/ O
seafood O
based O
filling O
. O

I O
like O
to O
eat O
the O
vermicelli O
roll O
with O
the O
sauce O
that O
comes O
with O
it O

The O
joy O
of O
eating O
the O
Golden B
Egg I

Lava I

( O

started O
from O
the O
excitement O
when O
we O
broke O
apart O
the O
soft O
, O
pillowy O
dough O
to O
reveal O
a O
yellow O
, O
creamy O
fluid O
centre O
. O

and O
you O
can O
make O
as O
much O
noise O
as O
you O
want O
. O

Do O
expect O
to O
be O
seated O
next O
to O
strangers O
with O
narrow O

There's O
a O

Food O
: O
I O
can O
only O
confirm O
that O
the O
Baked B
char I
siew I
buns I
are O
as O
good O
as O
the O
original O
ones O
, O
but O
the O
size O
is O
2/3 O
that O
of O
the O
HK O
size O
. O

What O
was O
good O
about O
it O
though O
, O
was O
that O
this O
particular O

didn't O
give O
off O

The O

but O
in O

The O

could O

. O

the O
next O
2 O
courses O
though O
were O
very O
average O
for O
this O
quality O
of O
restaurant O
. O

It O
took O
us O
1.5 O
hours O
to O
get O
in O
. O

I O
ve O
heard O
so O
much O
about O
Victor O
s O
kitchen O
that O
when O
the O
dim O
sum O
cravings O
kicked O
in O
on O
a O
Sunday O
morning O
I O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
troop O
down O
there O
to O
taste O
for O
myself O
what O
the O
fuss O
was O
about O
. O

So O
naturally O
i O
liked O

appetising O
enough O

kick O
start O

My O
friend O
had O
to O
go O
around O
and O
seek O
for O
dim O
sum O
before O
we O
had O
a O
table O
of O

. O
Red O

style O
is O
having O
waitresses O
pushing O
the O

around O
to O
let O
customers O
choose O
their O
dim O

. O

First O
my O
friend O
ask O
me O
to O
go O
there O
, O
cos O
she O
found O
it O
at O
some O
travel O
guide O
book O
. O

Nicely O
flaky O
but O
not O
overly O
so O
, O
with O
a O
firm O
eggy O
centre O
. O

The O
skin O
of O
the O
Har B
Gau I
was O
way O
too O
starchy O
and O
gummy O
for O
my O
liking O
and O
the O
egg B

was O
a O
little O
too O
sweet O
and O
milky O
. O
