We O
had O
to O
ask O
for O
another O
pot O
after O
several O
requests O
and O
it O
happened O
3-4 O
times O
during O
our O
1hour O
stay O
there O

This O
is O

place O

I O
have O
been O
a O
loyal O
patron O
of O
Viktor's O
Kitchen O
for O
the O
last O
5 O
years O

rude O

went O
on O
to O
say O
loudly O
that O
we O
rejected O
the O
water O
coz O
payable O
. O

and O
i O
don't O
know O
whether O
its O
an O
odd O
practice O
, O
but O
i O
like O
to O
add O
vinegar O
to O
my O
noodles O
after O
the O
initial O
few O
samplings O
, O
because O
i O
think O
the O
vinegar O
adds O
a O
different O
and O
equally O
tasty O
twist O
to O
the O
noodles O
( O
usually O
i O
do O
it O
for O
e-fu O
noodles O
, O
but O
it O
seemed O
to O
work O
here O
as O
well O
) O
refreshing O
sorbet B
with I
herbal I

, O
aloe I

and I

ahh O
.. O

Snaking O
queues O
are O
still O
a O
common O
sight O
on O
a O
weekday O
morning O
and O
the O
establishment O
experiences O
an O
endless O
flurry O
of O
activity O
from O
day O
to O
night O
. O

And O
to O
state O
my O
disclaimer O
, O
some O
of O
the O
names O
listed O
for O
the O
dishes O
may O
be O
wrong O
, O
as O
I O
can O
absolutely O
not O
recall O
their O
names O
. O

! O

For O
good O
dim O
sum O
, O
I O
usually O
head O
to O
old O
favorites O
like O
Royal O
China O
and O
Wah O
Lok O
for O
my O
fix O
. O

Decent O
yes O
, O
but O
nothing O
spectacular O
. O

Slightly O
crispy O
and O
fragrant O
. O

Had O
the O
porridge B
that O
was O
recommended O
to O
me O
from O
others O
but O
nothing O
to O
boast O
about O
. O

Praises O

for O
30mins O

.. O

overall O
rather O
surprisingly O
, O
my O
recent O
excellent O
dinner O
at O
tunglok O
signature O
@ O
central O
was O
so O
much O
better O
than O
this O
taste-wise O
the O
sea O
cucumber O
was O
superb O
& O
as O
good O
if O
not O
better O
than O
the O
abalone O
here O
, O
and O
all O
the O
other O
dishes O
were O
better O
! O

Saving O
the O
best O
for O
the O
most O
deserved O
would O
be O
Milky B
Custard I
Bun I
. O

Cod B
fish I
- O
Again O
not O
a O
fan O
of O
cod O
fish O
but O
definitely O
one O
of O
the O
better O
ones O
out O
there O
. O

The O
crust O
was O
flaky O
; O
there O
was O
a O
generous O
amount O
of O
egg O
fillings O
which O
weren O
t O
too O
sweet O
. O

Small O
portion O
of O
century O
egg O
, O
but O
it's O
not O
so O
bad O
if O
you O
got O
a O
craving O
for O
century B
egg I
porridge I
. O

Oh O
, O
try O
the O
tim O
sum O
too O
, O
watch O
out O
for O
the O
strolling O
trolleys O
! O

These O
tasted O
like O
angel O
food O
cake O
... O

Went O
with O
my O
mum O
and O
I O
and O
they O
only O
bother O
to O
serve O
all O
the O
big O
tables O
with O
6-10 O
ppl O
. O
Boo O
. O

Other O
minor O
surprises O
came O
in O
the O
form O
of O
somewhat O
unconventional O
yum O
cha O
items O
like O
paper-wrapped B
chicken I
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
was O
too O
starchy O
and O
gravy-laden O
. O

2 O
. O

nice O
. O

The O
baked B
bun I
with I
BBQ I
pork I
was O
great O
but O
one O
person O
can O
only O
order O
a O
set O
of O
3 O
. O

fried O
/ O
baked O
( O
yam B
fritter I
$ O
2 O
) O
- O
the O
fritters O
reeked O
of O
ammonia O
, O
its O
pungency O
strong O
enough O
to O
be O
off-putting O
. O

She O
came O
back O
with O
a O
wrong O
order O
for O
my O
friend O
and O
stingy O
amount O
of O
milk O
. O

Of O
all O
the O
dishes O
, O
this O
is O
my O
personal O
favourite O
. O

Special O
mention O
to O
staff O
- O
Joy O
. O

the O
carrot B
cake I
was O
good O
, O
while O
the O
siew B
mai I
was O
surprisingly O
less O
appetizing O
than O
the O
ones O
i O
get O
from O
the O
kopitiam O
near O
my O
house O
. O

There's O
no O
service O
charge O
so O
don't O
expect O
smiles O
or O
more O
. O

Nice O
place O
to O
go O
on O
a O
weekend O
lunch O
. O

The O
XLBs B
here O
really O
has O
the O
standard O
of O
some O
famous O
chinese O
restaurants O
, O
but O
at O
a O
cheaper O
price O
. O

Yes O
the O
ingredients O
were O
fresh O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
found O
it O
. O

I O
like O
to O
eat O
dim O
sum O
, O
esspecially O
shaomai B
/ O
shumai B
( O
not O
so O
sure O
how O
to O
spell O
this O
) O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
the O
trio O
was O
ambrosial O
and O
exquisite O
. O

I O
will O
be O
back O
with O
more O
friends O
so O
we O
can O
order O
a O
greater O
variety O
to O
share O
. O

I've O
tried O
quite O
a O
number O
of O
their O
dishes O
, O
so O
here's O
a O
breakdown O
of O
' O
em O
: O
- O
Sichuan B
Chilly I
Oil I
Wanton I
/ O
( O
$ O
3.30 O
, O
4 O
pieces O
) O
which O
comes O
in O
a O
spicy O
vinegar-based O
sauce O
. O

Choon O
Dim O
Sum O
Restaurant O
in O
operation O
for O
more O
than O
50 O
years O
is O
a O
well-known O
dim O
sum O
restaurant O
which O
is O
extremely O
popular O
among O
Singaporeans O
and O
tourist O
. O

with O
the O
Q O
bite O
. O

Siew B
Mai I
( O
$ O
4.00 O
) O
was O
chewy O
and O
all O
, O
but O
we O
were O
more O
than O
pleased O
to O
find O
out O
the O
large O
and O
fresh O
shrimp O
that O
resides O
at O
the O
bottom O
of O
each O
Siew B
Mai I
! O

The O
place O
was O
quite O
crowded O
at O
6.30 O
pm O
but O
we O
managed O
to O
find O
a O
seat O
near O
the O
door O
. O

Beautiful O
renovation O
with O
Chinese O
musical O
music O
playing O
in O
the O
background O

Drunken B

( O
$ O
5.50 O
) O
- O
Both O
of O
us O
were O
overwhelmed O
by O
the O
strong O
and O
extremely O
sharp O
taste O
of O
the O
wine O
. O

Definitely O
thick O
, O
yet O
not O
turning O
all O
starchy O
when O
it O
started O
to O
cool O
. O

Commendable O
, O
worth O
the O
try O
! O
! O

quite O
value O
for O
money O
. O

For O
full O
review O
, O
please O
refer O
to O

Indeed O
, O
very O
crowded O
during O
lunch O
time O
... O

Service O
is O
good O
. O

Pan-fried B
Pork I
Dumpling I
was O
nice O
and O
a O
pleasant O
surprise O
when O
we O
found O
it O
have O
juices O
inside O
like O
Xiao O
long O
bao O
. O

It O
was O
decent O
, O
but O
not O
the O
best O
. O

It O
is O
even O
sadder O
that O
the O
boss O
, O
Viktor O
, O
and O
his O
wife O
, O
could O
not O
care O
less O
about O
their O
staffs O
' O
attitude O
. O

The O
Chrysantheum B
Tea I
was O
quite O
good O
as O
it O
was O
light O
, O
refreshing O
, O
fragrant O
and O
help O
to O
wash O
down O
the O
grease O
. O

At O
this O
price O
, O
I O
can O
get O
better O
tasted O
and O
quality O
dimsum O
in O
chinatown O
coffeeshop O
. O

The O
har B
gow I
were O
juicy O
and O
tasty O
, O
likewise O
for O
the O
carrot B
cake I
and O
siew B
mai I
. O

poor O
service O
. O

This O
Fried B
Golden I
Doufu I
( O
Tofu O
) O
$ O
3.50 O
was O
surprisingly O
good O
. O

Victor O
will O
go O
, O
Hello O
, O
hao-pang-yao O
! O

starts O
bombarding O
us O
with O
questions O
on O
what O
we O
want O
to O
eat O
. O

To O
put O
the O
record O
straight O
, O
the O
service O
was O
reasonably O
good O
, O
even O
though O
I O
dined O
in O
the O
early O
evening O
of O
a O
weekday O
. O

Got O
there O
and O
found O
the O
table O
to O
be O
in O
the O
same O
mess O
as O
the O
previous O
patrons O
left O
it O
. O

Utterly O
disappointed O
. O

They O
were O
busy O
talking O
to O
the O
lady O
boss O
and O
the O
other O
workers O
, O
checking O
their O
ICs O
etc O
. O

Ambience O
wise O
it's O
a O
really O
simple O
place O
where O
people O
eat O
and O
go O
, O
no O
fanciful O
do O
ups O
just O
honest O
food O
. O

The O
ambience O
was O
very O
nice O
, O
all O
zen O
and O
dark O
wood O
and O
peaceful O
. O

Note O
, O
order O
the O
steamed O
one O
, O
not O
the O
deep B
fried I
bean I
curd I
roll I
, O
because O
the O
flavour O
and O
juiciness O
is O
completely O
lost O
in O
the O
latter O
. O

The O
porridge O
wasn't O
real O
Cantonese O
style O
porridge O
either O
, O
and O
came O
in O
such O
a O
small O
bowl O
. O

although O
the O
sauce O
that O
was O
served O
with O
the O
cheong O
fun O
was O
not O
the O
best O
i've O
tasted O
, O
overall O
, O
it O
was O
still O
a O
pretty O
good O
dish O
. O

Surely O
the O
establishment O
is O
getting O
its O
dim O
sum O
right O
. O

i O
visited O
vic's O
kitchen O
on O
2/5 O
/ O
2011 O
. O

Called O
the O
manager O
and O
he O
kept O
avoiding O
us O
purposely O
doing O
stuff O
to O
avoid O
us O
. O

We O
ordered O
quite O
a O
few O
dishes O
, O
such O
as O
the O
vermicelli O
roll O
, O
carrot B
cake I
, O
dumplings O
, O
etc O
. O

let's O
start O
the O
show O

That O
said O
, O
the O
ambience O
of O
the O
place O
was O
nice O
, O
without O
much O
of O
crowd O
- O
there O
were O
just O
4 O
tables O
filled O
on O
a O
Sat O
night O
. O

Decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
go O
after O
reading O
past O
reviews--alone O
. O

If O
you O
don't O
like O
to O
queue O
for O
about O
half O
an O
hour O
at O
Plaza O
Singapore O
outlet O
, O
one O
can O
try O
going O
to O
the O
Tim O
Ho O
Wan O
outlet O
in O
Toa O
Payoh O
area O
at O
Lorong O

ERA O
Hersing O
Centre O
#02-02 O
, O
very O
short O
queue O
. O

:] O
* O
sorry O
for O
the O
rant O
* O
went O
for O
lunch O
there O
about O
3 O
weeks O
ago O
, O
my O
1st O
time O
trying O
. O

Speaking O
of O
service O
, O
likewise O
to O
all O
the O
restaurants O
in O
Mandarin O
Oriental O
, O
including O
Dolce O
Vita O
, O
Melt O
and O
Mortons O
, O
I O
can't O
think O
of O
any O
negative O
thing O
to O
say O
for O
the O
impeccable O
service O
. O

The O
beautiful O
, O
each O
piece O
: O
Oh-so-dainty O
, O
Oh-so-refine O
. O

However O
, O
note O
that O
there O
is O
a O
limit O
to O
the O
number O
of O
plates O
you O
can O
order O
, O
1 O
person O
can O
only O
order O
1 O
plate O
of O
char B
siew I
bao I
, O
so O
if O
you're O
intending O
to O
order O
takeaway O
for O
it O
, O
you O
won't O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O
unless O
you're O
with O
a O
group O
of O
friends O
. O

Still O
good O
enough O
for O
a O
really O
late O
supper O
or O
very O
early O
breakfast O
. O

And O
if O
vic's O
kitchen's O
staff O
or O
customers O
ever O
visit O
this O
page O
and O
saw O
this O
post O
, O
take O
note O
if O
this O
big O
eyes O
, O
slim O
auntie O
around O
40 O
+ O
+ O
who O
has O
a O
serious O
attitude O
problem O
and O
poor O
customer O
service O
! O

extremely O
rude O
. O

Service O
was O
good O
. O

My O
parents O
brought O
me O
there O
one O
Saturday O
morning O
to O
have O
breakfast O
with O
some O
of O
their O
friends O
. O

Not O
a O
long O
range O
of O
items O
though O
. O

Golden B
egg I
yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
. O

Crisp B
Fried I
Marinated I
Duck I
stuffed I
with I
Glutinous I
Rice I
is O
something O
that O
you O
should O
try O
at O
Cherry O
Garden O
. O

I O
don't O
know O
the O
reason O
why O
this O
restaurant O
is O
so O
popular O
. O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
quite O
strange O
because O
we O
hadn't O
even O
decided O
on O
the O
food O
yet O
, O
hence O
, O
wouldn't O
know O
what O
wine O
because O
you O
would O
want O
to O
pair O
it O
with O
the O
food O
. O

Great O
Fusion O
Buffet O
. O

The O
dried O
prawn O
with O
chili O
is O
good O
! O

People O
will O
still O
go O
to O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
via O
word O
of O
mouth O
. O

even O
the O
texture O
cannot O
make O
it O
. O

Nothing O
can O
really O
describe O
how O
surprised O
and O
in O
love O
I O
am O
with O
this O
bun O
. O

As O
a O
Michelin O
star O
restaurant O
, O
I O
believe O
the O
service O
and O
food O
quality O
should O
be O
excellent O
and O
responsive O
We O
waited O
fo O
less O
than O
20 O
minutes O
at O
about O
5pm O
on O
Tuesday O
. O

and O
that's O
without O
considering O
the O
price O
. O

To O
us O
Victor O
s O
Kitchen O
is O
really O
not O
worth O
going O
. O

I O
was O
there O
on O
friday O
7/9 O
/ O
12 O
. O

The O
use O
of O
fish O
skin O
, O
for O
the O
translucent O
was O
great O
for O
the O
eyes O
, O
but O
not O
for O
the O
mouth O
. O

I O
like O
their O
meesua B
kway I
here O
, O
which O
is O
similar O
to O
fried O
carrot B
cake I
, O
but O
inner O
is O
filled O
with O
meesua O
. O

Have O
to O
admit O
it O
was O
cripsy O
on O
the O
outside O
, O
and O
soft O
goodness O
on O
the O
inside O
. O

There O
was O
a O
queue O
of O
about O
2 O
couples O
in O
front O
of O
me O
. O

Soya B
Bean I
... O

but O
my O
boyfren O
didn't O
like O
the O
beancurd O
taste O
. O

Plus O
the O
cheap O
price O
. O

I O
still O
do O
not O
understand O
it's O
crowd O
patronizing O
and O
what's O
so O
nice O
abt O
it O
. O

The O
service O
was O
bad O
for O
its O
standards O
, O
staff O
were O
talking O
among O
themselves O
.. O

( O
- O
) O
The O
poster O
showed O
it O
was O
cheapest O
at O
S O
$ O
3.50 O
, O
guess O
not O
anymore O
. O

Next O
time O
for O
comfort O
food O
I'll O
just O
walk O
to O
Takashimaya O
. O

We O
were O
enjoying O
our O
dimsums O
when O
we O
heard O
a O
small O
commotion O
and O
my O
girlfriend O
asked O
me O
to O
look O
at O
the O
kitchen O
/ O
counter O
s O
direction O
. O

A O
little O
sticky O
and O
fluffy O
taste O
. O

Immediately O
, O
the O
smile O
left O
and O
she O
murmured O
, O
' O
You O
all O
don't O
understand O
. O

my O
bf O
lurveee O
this O
... O

I O
mean O
I O
have O
pork O
for O
almost O
every O
meal O
I O
had O
and O
Dim O
Sum O
is O
no O
exception O
. O

Very O
crispy O
and O
light O
. O

One O
thing O
about O
Red O
Star O
is O
that O
they O
never O
stinge O
on O
the O
ingredients O
despite O
the O
crowd O
. O

Food O
took O
forever O
even O
though O
first O
to O
submit O
order O
( O
that's O
okay O
) O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
they O
do O
not O
provide O
baby O
chair O
hence O
we O
stacked O
2 O
chairs O
for O
each O
of O
the O
kid O
. O

The O
variety O
of O
dim O

Service O
is O
polite O

slow O

I O
found O
is O
quite O
typical O
in O
Singapore O
compare O
to O
Toronto O

We O

This O

i O
eat O

almost O
on O
a O

at O
all O

as O

dim O

and O
i O
must O
say O
that O
the O
dim O
sum O
at O
swee O
choon O
definitely O
matches O
the O
quality O
of O
what O
you O
would O
get O
at O
any O
of O
the O
high O
end O
restaurants O
, O
and O
i O
have O
become O
a O
regular O
patron O
of O
the O
place O
and O
it O
is O
high O
on O
my O
list O
of O
supper O
places O
. O

This O
was O
undoubtedly O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
and O
I O
am O
not O
even O
a O
fan O
of O
BBQ O
pork O
buns O
! O

anyway O
, O
this O
bun O
is O
simply O
unbeatable O
. O

( O
- O
) O
Was O
good O
, O
but O
definitely O
not O
as O
good O
as O
acclaimed O
and O
described O
. O

It O
might O
come O
across O
as O
a O
tad O
too O
sweet O
for O
some O
, O
but O
it O
s O
fine O
for O
me O
. O

Yes O
, O
she O
simply O
raised O
her O
hand O
for O
me O
to O
stop O
talking O
. O

Patience O
brings O
good O
food O
. O

as O
she O
obviously O
had O
difficulty O
speaking O
& O
understanding O
english O
as O
we O
were O
leaving O
the O
restaurant O
i O
asked O
a O
second O
time O
the O

( O
maybe O
filipino O
) O
. O

oh O
yes O
... O

Ambience O
Excellent O
interior O
done O
up O
to O
resemble O
days O
of O
ancient O
China O
. O

But O
it O
really O
put O
me O
off O
, O
it O
was O
because O
it O
was O
only O
allowed O
a O

go O

my O
personal O

would O
be O
the O

! O

The O
dim O

were O
not O
great O
. O

But O
because O
it O
was O
a O
public O
holiday O
with O
many O

closed O
, O
we O
ended O

This O

Our O

We O
ended O
off O
with O

- O

ginko I

pieces O
of O

with O
hints O
of O
Chinese O

again O

It O
is O
typically O
very O
crowded O
and O
messy O
on O
weekends O
and O
be O
prepared O
to O
be O
served O
( O
or O
not O

by O

Beancurd B

was O
quite O
ok O

But O
i O
really O
really O
gotta O
say O
tat O
e O
food O
is O
really O
not O
expensive O
at O
all O
... O

so O
i O
wanted O
to O
go O
eat O
at O
a O
dim O
sum O
place O
last O
sunday O
, O
and O
we O
needed O
to O
get O
information O
on O
where O
to O
go O
. O

Service O
was O
minimal O
. O

A O
little O
like O
the O
Peking O
duck O
roll O
, O
just O
that O
it O
is O
filled O
with O
pork O
floss O
instead O
. O

The O
widely O
acclaimed O
Golden B
Egg I
Yolk I
Lava I
Bun I
did O
not O
disappoint O
, O
and O
I O
would O
pay O
return O
visits O
just O
for O
this O
item O
alone O
. O

we O
liked O
its O
balanced O
mixture O
of O
custardy O
sweetness O
, O
buttery O
fragrance O
and O
salted O
egg O
savoriness O
. O

It O
feels O
like O
a O
hong O
kong O
cafe O
, O
casual O
dining O
. O

I'm O
sorry O
. O

Aside O
from O
that O
, O
I O
also O
requested O
for O
century B
egg I
& I
lean I
meat I
porridge I
immediately O
after O
I O
sat O
down O
at O
the O
table O
. O

Pls O
keep O
it O
up O
with O
this O
consistent O
level O
of O
service O
, O
food O
quality O
and O
ambience O
. O

Typically O
there O
is O
some O
waiting O
time O
needed O
during O
dinner O
time O
, O
but O
i O
thought O
the O
queue O
was O
moving O
quite O
fast O
. O

Hi O
all O
HGW O
followers O
, O
i O
am O
not O
a O
person O
who O
like O
to O
complain O
or O
to O
provide O
bad O
feedbacks O
, O
however O
this O
is O
the O
worst O
place O
i O
have O
ever O
been O
to O
so O
far O
. O

I O
had O
the O
slim O
hope O
of O
this O
place O
improving O
a O
little O
bit O
but O
it O
was O
not O
to O
be O
. O

Think O
carpeted O

with O
red O

. O

Service O
was O
good O

The O
banana-prawn B

was O
just O
as O
yummy O
as O
well O
. O

I O
invited O
my O
guests O
from O
the O
UK O
. O

This O
combination O
of O
the O
pork O
and O
yam O
is O
simply O
heavenly O
! O

They O
used O
to O
have O
small O
tables O
lined O
up O
outside O
the O
shop O
as O
well O
but O
someone O
complained O
about O
the O
crowd O
or O
something O
and O
now O
the O
tables O
have O
disappeared O
and O
two O

A O
must O
try O
here O
is O
the O
Crispy B
Fried I
Marinated I
Duck I
stuffed I
with I
Glutinous I
Rice I
. O

The O
actual O
won O
ton O
had O
too O
thick O
skin O
and O
the O
filling O
was O
bland O
. O

We O
protested O
! O

As O
of O
the O
service O
, O
cannot O
expect O
much O
due O
to O
the O
large O
crowd O
during O
the O
weekends O
. O

Congee B
was O
served O
in O
a O
small O
bowl O
and O
topped O
with O
crispy O
crackers O
and O
green O
onions O
. O

The O
pieces O
of O
pig's O
liver O
were O
extremely O
soft O
and O
they O
do O
not O
really O
possess O
the O
strong O
iron O
/ O
metal O
taste O
! O

It O
is O
in O
the O
between O
both O
Farrer O
Park O
and O
Lavendar O
MRT O
stations O
, O
a O
good O
10 O
to O
15 O
minutes O
walk O
away O
from O
either O
stations O
. O

The O
spicy O
flavor O
of O
onions O
and O
ginger O
was O
not O
too O
apparent O
for O
my O
liking O
here O
. O

The O

I O
ate O
so O
much O
that O
it's O
simply O
impossible O
to O
go O
thru O

every O

I O
must O
say O
their O
special O
that O
is O
fish B

chicken O

other O

we O
ordered O
like O
Chee B

various O

were O
ok O
tasting O

But O
if O
you're O
a O

person O
, O
you O
can O
drop O
by O
at O
9am O
( O
it O

and O
start O
queueing O

Overall O
, O
they O
have O
their O
hits O
and O
misses O
but O
if O
you O
know O
what O
to O
order O
, O
this O
place O
is O
great O
for O
dining O
and O
catching O
up O
in O
a O
lively O

I O
was O
fascinated O
with O
the O
attentive O

diligent O

of O

Thats O
is O

, O
this O
is O
the O

. O

We'll O
definitely O
come O
back O

we'll O

if O
you O
want O
a O
real O

of O
how O

you O

almost O

I O
wish O
we O
had O

In O
terms O

you O

However O
, O
since O
I O

at O
nine O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O

at O
this O

, O
so O
I O
thought O
that O
I O
might O
as O
well O
check O
it O
out O
. O

Feeling O
a O
little O
healthy O
, O
Tubby O
Hubby O
( O

and O
myself O
walked O
from O

Restaurant O
is O
no O

to O

and O
has O

almost O
50 O
years O

I O
see O
the O

mention O
that O
the O

I O
have O
been O
to O
the O
bedok O

, O
no O

at O
all O

The O
service O
was O
bad O
as O
we O
had O
to O
call O
the O
cart O
pushers O
many O
times O
before O
they O
came O
. O

Af O
first O
glance O
, O
the O
menu O
list O
didn't O
appear O
a O
lot O
but O
when O
you O
started O
eating O
your O
order O
, O
you'd O
be O
tempted O
to O
order O
same O
dish O
more O
than O
twice O
, O
so O
overall O
, O
afterward O
, O
we O
think O
the O

sadly O
not O
the O

since O

There O

which O
was O

about O

When O

What O
a O

start O
to O

The O

was O
a O

the O

were O
fairly O

It O
was O
with O
great O
scepticism O
that O
we O
decided O
to O
evoke O
that O
Singaporean O
spirit O
of O

up O

Conclusion O
is O
that O
it's O
value O
for O

but O
the O
service O
is O
just O
not O
up O
to O
expectations O
but O
what O
more O
can O
one O
expect O
if O
we O
weren't O
paying O

Victor's O

something O
to O
rave O
about O

On O
an O
average O
, O
about O
90 O
% O
of O
its O
dishes O
are O
of O
the O

standard O

Service O
here O
is O
very O
friendly O

My O

who O

from O

had O
been O
eating O

her O
entire O

definitely O
knows O
more O
about O

I O
do O

her O
verdict O

i'd O
say O
it's O
around O
the O
standard O

whatever O
that O
is O
. O

Hmm O
, O
my O
verdict O
is O
that O
I O
would O
go O
early O
for O
it O
but O
I O
wouldn't O
queue O
so O
long O
for O
it O
. O

When O
it O
was O
firstly O
opened O
, O
I O
already O
want O
to O
go O
in O
and O
try O
it O
out O
. O

Red O
Star O
had O
slightly O
higher O
pricing O
but O
way O
way O
better O
food O
. O

I O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
ladies O
to O
go O
in O
groups O
of O
at O
least O
3-4 O
or O
have O
the O
company O
of O
males O
due O
to O
the O
large O
number O
of O

to O
boil O

we O
ordered O

and O
it O
was O
rather O

In O
short O
, O
i O
can O
confidently O
say O
i O
wont O
step O
in O
that O

again O

The O
waiting O
was O
a O

i O
see O
my O

who O
arrived O
and O
ordered O
20 O
min O

than O

I O

I O
would O

this O

to O
anyone O
thinking O
of O
going O
to O
Red O

in O
the O
future O

Not O
too O

so O
good O
that O
I O
could O
not O
stop O
eating O
once O

the O

K O
sat O

remarked O
that O

were O
mostly O
brusque O

unsmiling O
throughout O
our O
meal O

was O
no O

at O
all O

the O

were O
good O

the O

was O

I O
recall O
having O
to O

to O
get O
the O
attention O
of O
the O

We O
ordered O

the O

when O

most O

of O

and O
a O
smooth O

in O
the O
centre O

When O
I O
alerted O
the O
waiter O
he O
apologized O
and O
took O
my O
plate O
away O
immediately O
trying O
to O
appease O
me O
by O
saying O
he O
would O
bring O
a O
new O
dish O
for O
me O
, O
but O
by O
that O
time O
I O
had O
lost O
my O
appetite O

A O
very O
unique O
dish O
to O
speak O
of O
- O
with O
the O
crispyness O
of O
the O
fried O
dough O
sticks O
in O
contrast O
to O
the O
silky O
rice O

, O
and O
together O
with O
the O
sweet O
black O
sauce O
, O
the O
combination O
was O
simply O
out O
of O
this O
world O
! O

Although O
expensive O
, O
I O
won't O
mind O
paying O
for O
the O
great O

that O

and O
stay O
open O

a O

What's O
most O
important O
is O
that O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
we O
all O
agreed O
that O
this O
was O
somewhere O
we O
would O
return O
to O
with O
friends O
and O
family O
and O
felt O
that O
our O
money O
was O
well O
spent O
. O

Contrary O
to O
what O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
mentioned O
, O
we O
felt O
that O
the O
service O
was O
pretty O
good O

Just O

and O
hopefully O
the O
quality O
will O
remain O
consistently O
superb O
in O
this O

Their O

with O
a O
solid O

, O
not O
to O
mention O
being O
quite O
generous O
with O
their O

. O

When O
we O
first O
entered O
the O
place O
, O
it O
was O
noisy O
and O
very O
crowded O
. O

The O
first O
item O
was O
served O
shortly O
after O
we O
sat O
down O
- O
the O
Baked B

We O
took O
the O
initiative O
to O
stack O
2 O
plastic O
chairs O
so O
that O
the O
kids O
could O
sit O
higher O
onto O
the O
table O
but O
one O
of O
the O
lady O
wearing O
a O
apron O
at O
the O
cashier O
* O
( O
should O
be O
another O
lady O

) O
said O
we O
do O
not O
have O
enough O

so O
you O
cant O
do O
that O
. O

My O
first O
time O
eating O
at O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
and O
the O
experience O
had O
totally O
spoiled O
our O
family's O
mood O
on O
National O

Next O
to O
us O
sat O
an O
elderly O
lady O
and O
her O
daughter O
, O
and O
boy O
, O
the O
service O
crew O
was O
really O
helpful O
, O
providing O
the O
elderly O
lady O
with O
the O
help O
she O
needed O
to O
get O
up O
from O
her O
seat O
, O
with O
her O
food O
etc O
. O

WIDE O

Staff O
told O
us O
no O
need O
to O
queue O
, O
can O
just O
walked O
in O
. O

But O
it's O
worth O
the O
wait O
, O
served O
in O
a O
dish O
filled O
with O
ice O
& O
water O
with O
the O
cup O
of O
tea O
emerged O
in O
the O
centre O
. O

The O
portuguese B
eggtarts I
were O
tasty O
due O
to O
the O
pastry O
and O
still O
tasted O
good O
even O
though O
left O
there O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

The O
Mango B

was O
not O
too O

extremely O
thick O

it O
s O
a O

in O

though O
definitely O
un-rave-worthy O

The O
food O
is O

So O
bought O
a O

Good O

Walk O

into O
this O

that O
has O
been O
designed O
to O
mimic O
a O

The O

exceptionally O
huge O
compared O
to O

and O
siding O
more O
all O
the O
juicy O
and O

The O

The O

One O
of O
the O

Waiting O
for O
your O

to O
be O
served O
on O
your O
table O
one O
at O
a O
time O
is O
inevitable O
as O
the O
orders O
are O
freshly O
prepared O
. O

We O
ordered O
and O
about O
15 O
minutes O
after O
that O
, O
come O
our O
other O
2 O
friends O
, O
ordering O
in O
separate O
time O
. O

We O
also O
had O
their O
queen O
siew B

and O

, O
because O
the O
steamed O

wasn't O

The O

much O
raved O
abt O

what's O

we O
were O
still O
not O
satisfied O

their O

although O
the O
filling O
was O
moist O
and O
the O
shell O
crispy O
, O
we O
had O
difficulty O
finishing O
the O

. O

But O
I O
prefer O
the O
fluffy O
kind O
of O

Their O

is O
great O

Defintely O

for O
the O

but O
the O

Try O
their O

you'll O
know O
how O
fresh O
and O
big O
their O

are O
. O

And O
I O
m O
glad O
I O
finally O
did O
. O

However O
, O
I O
must O
say O
that O
I O
was O
quite O
disappointed O
with O
the O
standard O
of O
the O

I O
were O
ushered O
to O
a O
table O

Steamed B

Although O
it O
is O
cheap O
but O
the O
food O
is O
good O
. O

Even O
the O
dessert O
were O
pretty O
good O
. O

The O
filling O
was O
not O
very O
generous O
and O
the O
skin O
too O
oily O
. O

Two O

the O

is O
especially O
tender O

Portions O

shrank O
but O
its O
still O
good O
since O
its O
a O

You O
wouldn't O

it O
if O
you O
don't O

Most O
important O

the O

I O
would O
also O
recommend O
Glutinous B

Yet O

the O

the O

Some O

My O
dining O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
other O
items O
on O
the O

, O
hence O
no O

on O
those O

not O
mentioned O
above O
. O

Tim O
sum O
price O
is O
reasonable O
but O
other O
special O

are O
expensive O

If O
you O

the O

a O
little O
costly O

Dim O

, O

, O
rice O

noodles O

desserts O
were O
unlimited O
. O

But O
I O
realise O
, O
the O
restaurant O
is O
just O
behind O
OG O
. O

I O
was O
still O
very O
much O
taken O
by O
the O
classic O
oriental O
decor O
with O
the O
dark O
wooden O
beams O
, O
red O
lanterns O
and O
pavilion O
like O

corners O

The O
entire O

there O
and O
wants O
to O
have O
a O

somewhat O
experience O
of O

look O
at O
the O
luscious O

if O
the O
service O
provided O
was O
acceptable O
i O
wouldn't O
have O
been O
so O
irked O

but O
what O
pissed O
me O
off O
the O
most O
was O
the O

auntie O
, O
who O
kept O
bugging O
us O
while O
we O
were O
ordering O
from O
another O
auntie O
, O
asking O
us O
you O
want O
anot O
? O
ni O

? O
and O
we O
had O
to O
tell O
her O
wait O

give O
us O
a O
minute O
. O

Ever O
seen O
on O
of O
those O
Tim O

they O
serve O
piping O

the O
wheel O
carts O
in O
those O
HK O
dramas O
and O
movies O
? O
? O
? O
Wait O
no O
more O
. O

But O
this O
was O
really O
disappointing O
. O

I O
have O
not O
visited O
this O
restaurant O
for O
more O
than O
5yrs O
and O
this O
re-visit O
is O
a O
pleasant O
experience O
. O

The O
shrimp O
rolls O
absorbed O
the O
delicious O
sauce O
and O
was O
really O
tasty O
. O

The O
you B
tiao I
stuffed I
with I
sotong I

tasted O
stale O
. O

I O
also O
like O
the O
Xian B
Zhu I

as O
it O
is O
nicely O
fried O
with O
abundant O
filling O
. O

It O
was O
served O
in O
a O
metal O
pot O
and O
is O
refillable O
. O

Shouldn't O
there O
be O
a O
replacement O
? O

The O
last O
dish O
reminded O
me O
of O
days O
when O
we O
went O
to O
Keong O
Saik O
Rd O
to O
eat O
this O
famous O
dish O
and O
this O
dish O
is O
equally O
good O

YOUR O
TIME O

MONEY O

should O
you O
be O
treated O

My O

a O

And O
our O

off O
with O
the O
highly O
raved O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
an O
occasional O
splurge O
would O
justify O
a O
visit O
to O
cherry O
garden O
but O
if O
you O
want O
to O
have O
good O

then O
it O

better O
to O

We O
browsed O
through O
the O

couldn't O
decide O
on O

the O

a O

this O
is O
one O

you O
can O
try O

something O

Even O
though O
it O
doesn O
t O
quite O
match O
up O
to O
the O
ones O
in O
Taiwan O
, O
it O
managed O
to O
satisfy O
my O
craving O

Some O
of O
my O
friends O
have O
warned O
me O
about O
the O
lack O
of O
service O
over O
at O
the O
eatery O
but O
during O
my O
visit O
( O
s O
) O
, O
the O
staff O
and O
all O
were O
rather O
courteous O
and O
polite O
. O

I O
am O
the O
only O
one O
among O
us O
who O
knows O
how O
to O
eat O

we O
have O
ordered O
some O
of O

as O
advised O
by O
Felicia O
herself O
and O
find O
most O
of O
the O

The O

when O
drenched O
in O
the O

, O
was O
delicious O
! O

And O
i've O
always O
prefered O
soft O
food O
so O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
crispy O
for O
me O
but O
I O
really O
liked O
the O

bite O
off O
the O
dumpling O
and O
the O

out O
together O
with O
the O

I O
had O
personally O
enjoyed O
the O
gastronomical O
experience O
. O

No O
need O
to O
cut O
the O
eggs O
with O
the O
spoon O
. O

There O
was O
a O
lingering O
herb O
flavor O
which O
overwhelmed O
the O
sweet O
elements O
of O
the O
hot O
dessert O
, O
I O
would O
personally O
prefer O
the O
other O
sweet O
and O
cold O
desserts O
. O

Quite O
fragrant O
but O
i O
personally O
think O
it O
could O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
spicy O
. O

so O
were O
the O
steamed B
carrot I
cakes I
. O

The O
only O
negative O
part O
was O
that O
the O
waitresses O
lack O
a O
friendly O
smile O
, O
otherwise O
it O
was O
perfect O
! O

Even O
though O
we O
were O
quite O
full O
, O
we O
finish O
it O
all O

me O
get O
to O
the O

We O
were O
served O
by O
a O
waitress O
called O
Joy O

With O
one O
bite O
, O
you O
have O
yin O
of O
the O
smooth O
rice O

and O
the O
yang O

the O
combination O
was O
simply O
unbelievable O
. O

- O
Carrot B

The O
only O
consolation O
was O
that O
all O
the O
aunties O
were O
very O
ON O
selling O
the O
dim O
sum O
and O
service O
was O
still O
good O
. O

Did O
I O
mention O
the O
duck O
and O
dim O
sum O
is O
a O
Must O
! O

Total O
bill O
was O
$ O
69.85 O
for O
two O
person O
. O

Creates O
a O
crunch O
when O
biting O

I O
had O
a O
very O
good O
first O
outing O
there O
, O
and O
as O
I O
was O
on O
my O
way O
there O
today O
, O
I O
had O
images O
of O
fluffy O
char B
siew I
bao I
, O
steaming O
har B
gao I
and O
thick O
gooey O
porridge B
floating O
around O
in O
my O
head O
... O
I O
was O
strangely O
disappointed O
. O

Coupled O
with O
good O
food O
and O
nice O
people O
, O
it's O
definitely O
the O
place O
to O
have O
dim O
sum O
. O

I O
won't O
return O
for O
the O
Chef's O
creation O
but O
for O
the O
other O
dishes O
. O

Xiaolongbao B
is O
also O
a O
signature O
dish O
at O
Swee O
Choon O
not O
exactly O
a O
HK O
dish O
but O
who O
cares O
if O
it O
s O
done O
well O
! O

One O
good O
thing O
i O
just O
wan O
to O
stress O
on O
is O
the O
price O
. O

I O
was O
there O
for O
the O
first O
time O
so O
it O
was O
nice O
that O
the O
waiter O
made O
recommendations O
. O

After O
trying O
some O
in O
Taiwan O
street O
market O
, O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
this O
, O
water O
chicken O
in O
Singapore O
for O
the O
longest O
time O
. O

And O
although O
everyone O
loves O
the O
fried B
mee I
sua I
here O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
wasn't O
much O
of O
a O
to O
die O
for O
item O
. O

gets O
crowded O
during O
dinner O
and O
supper O
times O
. O

Service O
was O
not O
too O
shabby O
, O
due O
to O
plenty O
of O
staff O
, O
the O
service O
is O
quite O
prompt O
and O
appropriate O
. O

It O
may O
not O
be O
worth O
a O
deliiberate O
trip O
down O
, O
but O
if O
one O
is O
ever O
in O
the O
area O
, O
it's O
definitely O
one O
place O
to O
check O
out O
. O

the O
drunken B
prawn I
seems O
to O
be O
over O
powered O
by O
the O
pepper O
and O
the O
soup O
barely O
have O
any O
herbal O
taste O
. O

If O
you O
prefer O
the O
old O
time O
or O
HK O
style O
yum O
cha O
, O
this O
will O
be O
the O
one O
for O
you O
. O

The O
former O
, O
though O
a O
tad O
oily O
, O
was O
flavourful O
with O
juicy O
mushroom O
and O
tender O
chicken O
while O
the O
latter O
was O
not O
too O
salty O
. O

Their O
Har B
Gow I
/ O
Prawn B
dumplings I
were O
also O
yummy O
- O
the O
skin O
not O
too O
thick O
and O
nice O
succulent O
prawns O
. O

but O
overall O
, O
great O
fast O
service O
and O
worth O
the O
wait O
! O
! O

This O
is O
what O
I O
like O
about O
the O
older O
restaurants O
. O

It O
was O
around O
3pm O
. O

I O
won O
t O
specially O
return O
to O
Victor O
s O
Kitchen O
as O
the O
environment O
just O
does O
not O
fit O
the O
price O
of O
$ O
3 O
- O
$ O
4.50 O
for O
a O
basket O
of O
dim O
sum O
but O
if O
I O
do O
return O
there O
, O
it O
has O
to O
be O
for O
the O
golden B
egg I
yolk I
lava I
bun I
and O
nothing O
else O
. O

It O
was O
bouncy O
and O
had O
bite O
to O
it O
but O
lacked O
the O
wow O
factor O
. O

haha O
you're O
probably O
thinking O
, O
what O
a O
laggard O
- O
. O

Seriously O
. O

My O
mom O
loves O
it O
too O
. O

Nothing O
like O
the O
flat O
, O
hot O
crispy O
crust O
which O
we O
had O
at O
other O
chn O
rstnt O
. O

Taste O
of O
food O
is O
very O
dependent O
on O
a O
person's O
mood O
/ O
experiences O
/ O
time O
of O
previous O
meal O
. O

It O
was O
just O
the O
right O
texture O
and O
it O
wasn't O
too O
salty O
! O

As O
for O
the O
dim O
sum O
, O
they O
are O
not O
bad O
, O
but O
are O
nowhere O
comparable O
to O
the O
ones O
I O
have O
in O
my O
favourite O
restaurants O
take O
note O
that O
the O
price O
is O
comparable O
though O
. O

i O
tot O
it O
might O
b O
those O
HK O
style O
but O
turned O
out O
to O
b O
those O
breakfast O
type O
but O
sadly O
e O
sweet O
sauce O
ain't O
nice O
me O
no O
likey O
.. O

) O
The O
Siew O
Mai O
had O
too O
much O
fatty O
meat O
and O
is O
incredibly O
expensive O
at O
$ O

. O

We O
ordered O
few O
dishes O
. O

Granted O
it O
was O
fathers O
day O
, O
but O
i O
bumped O
into O
a O
friend O
there O
and O
he's O
a O
regular O
, O
and O
he O
advised O
us O
that O
its O
a O
usual O
30 O
min O
wait O
unless O
you O
come O
in O
the O
afternoon O
on O
weekdays O
. O

the O
food O
is O
decent O
and O
when O
compare O
to O
imperial O
treasure O
which O
is O
price O
around O
the O
same O
. O

The O
cheong B
fun I
with I
dough I
fritters I

average O

have O
had O
better O

Frankly O

the O

I O
have O
longed O
to O
find O
the O
best O
sweet O
sour O
pork O
in O
Singapore O

They O
are O
the O

For O
Both O
The O
Young O
and O
Old O
Red O
Star O
Restaurant O
offers O
a O
splendid O
range O
of O
dim O
sum O
. O

Packed O
complete O
with O
fragrance O
and O
softness O
. O

The O
queue O
to O
get O
a O
table O
is O
scary O
, O
so O
be O
prepared O
. O

One O
of O
the O
servers O
even O
managed O
to O
strike O
up O
a O
quick O
conversation O
with O
us O
regarding O
the O
never-ending O
queue O
to O
enter O
the O
restaurant O
. O

This O
restaurant O
was O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
hotter O
venues O
for O
weddings O
back O
in O
the O
80s O
but O
well O
, O
it's O
time O
for O
an O
upgrade O
, O
to O
be O
honest O
. O

Come O
on O
, O
people O
. O

Cherry O
Garden's O
Crisp-Fried B
marinated I
duck I
stuffed I

Of O
these O
I O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
the O
fried B
prawn I
rolls I
, O
steamed B
pork I
ribs I
and O
custard B
buns I
. O

Good O
but O
not O
great O
. O

Then O
head O
inside O
where O
there's O
air-con O
and O
some O
booth O
seats O
along O
the O
white-tiled O
wall O

Nice O
combination O
between O
the O
salty O
and O
sweet O
flavour O
, O
Super O
Yummyy O

particularly O
like O
the O
salted B
egg I

and O
the O
chilled B

That's O
it O

Then O
again O
its O

me O
since O
so O
many O
people O
love O
this O

you O
are O
hungry O

a O
lot O
of O

are O
closed O

Dim O

are O
the O
usual O
suspects O

with O
prawns O
as O
the O
main O
ingredient O
in O
most O
of O
them O
. O

We O
went O
on O
a O
weekday O
before O
6pm O
and O
the O
queue O
was O
bearable O
, O
got O
a O
seat O
in O
less O
than O
30 O
min O
. O

Have O
it O
whilst O
hot O
. O

My O
family O
went O
to O
Cherry O
Garden O
for O
welcoming O
my O
uncle O
from O
overseas O
. O

- O
this O
fried O
fritters O
must O
be O
eaten O
wif O
the O
sauce O
to O
reduce O
the O
oilyness O
. O

You O
can O
also O
order O
satay O
from O
the O
coffee O
shop O
next O
door O
.. O

The O
har B
gows I
' O
skin O
had O
a O
mushy O
texture O
. O

Take O
my O
word O
for O
it O
and O
order O
at O
least O
three O
servings O
of O
this O
. O

everything O
cost O
about O
$ O
100 O
+ O
but O
because O
we O
had O
a O
$ O
30 O
voucher O
, O
it O
cost O
$ O
70 O
+ O
. O

The O
first O
is O
an O
closeup O
shot O
of O
the O
roach O
, O
the O
second O
a O
bit O
father O
away O
, O
and O
the O
third O
I O
tried O
to O
show O
part O
of O
the O
restaurant O
to O
show O
that O
it O
was O
at O
Red O
Star O
. O

( O
) O
B O
Don't O
be O
a O
fool O
, O
Don't O
go O
any O
more O
... O

Sometimes O
I O
wonder O
how O
could O
a O
Chinese O
survive O
without O
pork O
in O
their O
lives O
. O

Anyone O
wanna O
strike O
gold O
? O

Hence O
we O
ignored O
her O
. O

It O
was O
not O
all O
smooth-sailing O
, O
nothing O
was O
. O

simple O
sounding O
but O
awesome O
in O
taste O
! O

The O
hae O
bee O
hiam O
that O
came O
with O
it O
was O
REALLY O
good O
! O

Count O
it O
on O
our O
luck O
that O
we O
chose O
the O
eve O
of O
a O
public O
holiday O
( O
Vesak O
Day O
) O
to O
visit O
the O
restaurant O
, O
so O
the O
waiting O
time O
wasn't O
any O
shorter O
. O

We O
ordered O
the O
prawn O
and O
char B
Siew I
Cheong I
fun I
and O
found O
the O
vermicelli O
roll O
too O
thick O
- O
where O
id O
the O
finesse O
? O
? O

I'm O
surprised O
to O
see O
people O
recommend O
the O
egg B
tarts I
and O
chee B
cheong I
fan I
, O
because O
we O
thought O
they O
were O
just O
OK O
, O
but O
the O
fried B
prawn I
dumplings I
, O
carrot B
cake I
, O
fried B
bean I
curd I
skin I
and O
char B
siew I
sou I
were O
good O
. O

Finally O
the O
lotus B
leaf I
glutinous I
rice O
was O
not O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

Well O
, O
maybe O
a O
nicer O
ambience O
and O
setting O
. O

We O
didnt O
have O
chinese O
tea O
at O
all O
, O
but O
had O
water O
, O
but O
the O
charge O
is O
still O
$ O
1.20 O
regardless O
. O

so O
i'll O
alternate O
the O
two O
with O
an O
egg B
tart I
in O
between O
. O

I O
just O
love O
their O
xiao B
long I
bao I
( O
the O
best O
in O
Singapore O
) O
. O

Told O
another O
and O
only O
after O
abt O
another O
10-15 O
mins O
did O

When O
savoured O

had O
taken O
utmost O
pleasure O
in O
how O
the O
differing O
textures O
of O

complemented O
one O

So O
what O
can O
you O
expect O

find O

The O
ambience O
was O
more O
like O
the O
chinese O

of O
the O
old O
days O
, O
I O
expected O
a O
little O
more O

and O
was O
extremely O
soft O

and O

are O
pretty O
reasonable O

Ubnfortunately O

the O

. O

This O
is O
my O
ultimate O
favourite O
dim O
sum O
dish O
. O

The O
carrot B
cake I
was O
not O
the O
fried O
kind O
but O
soft O
mushy O
kind O
. O

The O
buns O
were O
fluffy O
and O
the O
salted O
egg O
custard O
was O
buttery O
and O
a O
right O
balance O
of O
sweet O
and O
savory O
. O

We O
were O
not O
chased O
away O
despite O
having O
finished O
our O
food O
, O
but O
we O
lingered O
a O
bit O
to O
nurse O
our O
hot O
cups O
of O
Chinese O
tea O
, O
which O
were O
regularly O
filled O
by O
the O
attentive O
wait O
staff O
. O

Overall O
, O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
and O
found O
it O
expensive O
for O
the O
quality O
of O
food O
unless O
you O
live O
in O
the O
area O
. O

Yesterday O
went O
to O
have O
a O
try O
in O
Victor's O
Kitchen O
. O

I've O
been O
here O
many O
times O
over O
a O
few O
years O
. O

I O
remember O
how O
my O
grandparents O
used O
to O
bring O
my O
siblings O
and O
I O
to O
the O
much O
talked O
about O
restaurant O
for O
its O
dim O
sum O
every O
Sunday O
morning O
. O

chao B
siew I
pao I
was O
nice O
and O
hot O
. O

Yet O
, O
we O
are O
not O
paying O
any O
less O
than O
a O
proper O
dimsum O
restaurant O
that O
serves O
with O
class O
. O

I've O
always O
loved O
the O
dim O
sum O
they O
have O
because O
it's O
not O
oily O
, O
fattening O
, O
or O
too O
jialat O
as O
some O
would O
describe O
. O

The O
sauce O
poured O
over O
it O
was O
a O
little O
tasteless O
and O
failed O
to O
lift O
the O
dish O
. O

2 O
. O

Achieving O
a O
crispy O
yet O
smooth O
texture O
, O
this O
dish O
was O
perfectly O
executed O
, O
with O
different O
dimensions O
of O
saltiness O
demonstrated O
by O
both O
the O
dough O
fritters O
and O
the O
soy O
sauce O
. O

There O
was O
only O
century O
egg O
in O
it O
and O
some O
fritters O
, O
no O
shreds O
of O
pork O
or O
anything O
. O

The O
skin O
was O
thin O
and O
the O
soup O
was O
flavourful O
. O

A O
must O
try O
is O
their O
signature O
dish O
- O
savoury O
fried B
mee I
sua I
cake I
... O

Part O
of O
the O
quartet O
, O
more O
commonly O
known O
as O
the O
4 O
Heavenly O
Kings O
, O
this O
dish O
still O
wins O
my O
mouth O
heart O
. O

This O
is O
the O
place O
that O
I O
will O
definitely O
go O
back O
again O
to O
try O
other O
dishes O
recommended O
by O
their O
Chef O
. O

The O
rest O
were O
only O
average O
and O
it O
is O
definately O
not O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

On O
top O
of O
the O
dim O
sum O
buffet O
, O
we O
could O
each O
order O
1 O
soup O
, O
1 O
appetizer O
, O
1 O
main O
dish O
and O
1 O
dessert O
. O

The O
taste O
was O
balanced O
and O
what O
we O
enjoyed O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
food O
was O
not O
oily O
nor O
salty O
. O

It O
wasn O
t O
very O
oily O
too O
so O
thumbs O
up O
for O
this O
. O

It O
s O
wrapped O
with O
Mee O
Sua O
as O
the O
name O
of O
the O
dish O
suggests O
it O
seems O
like O
a O
weird O
combination O
but O
it O
actually O
tastes O
decent O
. O

I O
have O
always O
hated O
this O
restaurant O
. O

The O
waitstaffs O
are O
not O
only O
inefficient O
, O
they O
are O
also O
rude O
and O
arrogant O
. O

( O
And O
yes O
, O
my O
husband O
& O
Victor O
has O
some O
how O
became O
BFF O
coz O
both O
were O
chatting O
in O
Cantonese O
when O
ever O
we O
patronize O
them O
. O

The O
savoury O
soup O
dripping O
out O
of O
those O
Baos O
, O
with O
a O
mild O
pork O
flavour O
, O
is O
just O
like O
sending O
the O
palates O
to O
a O
spa O
! O

The O
sweet O
and O
salty O
combination O
is O
by O
far O
the O
most O
perfect O
that O
I've O
tried O
. O

On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
the O
food O
is O
good O
. O

What O
happened O
to O
one O

proceeded O
to O
point O
to O
another O

that O
was O
already O
occupied O
by O
